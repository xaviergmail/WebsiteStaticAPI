A roar vibrates through Yui's body as she accelerates through a thick churning fog across a wasteland of crumbling pagodas and buildings.  She passes a wrecked motorcycle on the side of the road. Not far from the bike a rider tries to stand but collapses on a shattered leg. She can't stop. She won't stop. She needs to win. She needs to reach the… she's not sure anymore… She looks left and right as she zips past the ruins of her hometown. She passes the same rider again trying to escape the blazing wreck. Doesn't make any sense. Nothing makes sense. A demon yells in the fog. Seems like he's right behind her, lurking in the fog, waiting to jump out at her.  She maneuvers through piles of flesh and gore of fallen riders burning and sending puffs of swirling smoke up into the darkness. She yells helplessly and the dead, smoldering riders begin to evaporate into a column of light breaking through the darkness. A rider suddenly stands in front of her. She skids, loses control, and tumbles over the road. Her insides feel like mush. Things are broken everywhere. Cracked bones rip through her skin, spitting out black, warm fluid. She tries to rise but a bone jutting out of her black jeans won't let her stand. Like the fallen rider she ignored, she's broken, helpless and soaked in gasoline. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 370","Text":"Misato studies Yui closely. To dream of fog and darkness means you see yourself as an imposter… perhaps even a failure. Yui nods and absorbs her friend's interpretation. Misato sips her beer. To see light means you'll overcome whatever is holding you back. To dream of a crash or a dead end could mean the death of something you want… something you wish for. Yui sighs and doesn't know if she wants to hear all this. The demon? The Oni? Why was it chasing me? Misato nods. The Oni could mean you're struggling to maintain your humanity as you chase your dreams, that you may be torn between right and wrong, between good and evil. Misato laughs to herself as she finishes her beer.  Maybe winning isn' t everything. Maybe you're greedy. Maybe you're trying to swallow an ocean when a glass of water would suffice. Yui scoffs. Greedy? I'm broke and you're paying for the beers! Misato shakes a drunken finger at her. Greed isn't just about money, Yui. It's about wanting more of anything.  More races. More trophies. More fame. Maybe your need to prove yourself is killing something in you that doesn't want to die. Yui sighs and downs her beer. Enough stupid talk and more drinking. Behind her dismissive smile Yui believes her nightmare has nothing to do with ego or greed, but the anxiety of not having the money to pursue her dream. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 371","Text":"Maybe winning isn't everything… Might not be everything but it is rent money and groceries and beer for the next few weeks if she wins the Secret4. But before she can win, she must be given a chance to race. Shinji the favorite has found a way to keep Yui out of the race, convincing the organizers that a female racer would undermine the Secret4. It's chauvinistic. Barbaric. Dated. But it's also her reality. They're not used to someone of her calibre. Calibre? Shinji has no calibre. He cheats and humiliates and ridicules to get a psychological edge. She knows his game, and he knows he's going to have to race her one of these days. But for now, he tells them if she races, he won't, and since he's the current champ, they somehow believe they need him to attract the money. She's sitting out tomorrow's race. But she'll be there to cheer her good friend Hiro. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 372","Text":"Shinji trash talks Yui as she fills Hiro's ears with fighting words. Fighting words… That's what her grandmother used to call them. Words with wings that filled the mind and lifted the spirit. Words… words are more than words. They can build. They can destroy. They can empower. They can turn mice into gods and gods into mice. Shinji tells Hiro he's going to make an example out of him because he supports Yui. Hiro acts tough but Yui sees those fear heavy words crawling into his ear, feasting on his confidence and weighing him down. Shinji turns to Yui and makes fun of her hair, winks at her, and asks if she came to watch men ride. She doesn't dignify his shit with a comeback. She wants Hiro to win, but the termites have taken hold, and he's a shell of a rider on a bike about to crack. She whispers winning words in his ears like her grandmother used to do with her. But he doesn't know how to make those words work for him. He's lost and the race hasn't even begun yet. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 373","Text":"4 AM. Yui watches Hiro speed off and take the lead. Shinji and others follow close behind. Maybe her words did help. Hiro rounds the bend. She watches Shinji race beside him and lean in. He leans in close, extends his arm, and touches Hiro's shoulder. Just touches him. Not to push him or hurt him but to annoy him. To distract him. Hiro swears. Loses his focus. Loses control. An instant later he's skidding across with pavement with a wrecked bike leaving a trail of sparks and oil. His helmet is disintegrating layer by layer against the rough pavement like sandpaper. He needs help, but the other racers speed past him all trying to win the prize money. Hiro stands and staggers stupidly into the road. His helmet doesn't exist anymore, and his face has been razed to the bone. His mouth and lips are gone. There're just teeth where lips used to be. A shriek sends a shiver of fear up her spine as a car slams on the breaks, loses control and hits her good friend. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 374","Text":"Yui accelerates through the fog with a red-eyed demon chasing her. She skids out of control, breaks her legs, and drags herself helplessly through the fog. Footfalls thunder toward her, shaking the ground with every step. She looks over her shoulder but all she sees is the thickening fog. A boot crushes her hand. She looks up to face--herself. Yui awakens in a hospital by Hiro covered in bandages with tubes sticking out of him. Authorities don't know it was an illegal race. If they did, they'd all end up in jail. She's not sure if Hiro can understand her but she tries her best to comfort him. Doctor says you're lucky to be alive. She wants to tell him he'll never walk again but she can't bring herself to do it. She doesn't say anything. She can't say anything. One lapse in judgement and he lost everything. Could happen to anyone. Yui closes her eyes and for a moment imagines a world where she hunts that bastard down and kills him like a dog. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 375","Text":"Misato delivers some good news while they walk toward their favorite noodle dive. The organizers want her to race the Secret4. An unknown benefactor wants to see what she can do. Rumors echo of a billionaire wanting to help lifers realize their dreams.  None of it makes sense. Yui feels many things right now but an overpowering need to put Shinji in his place distracts her. But she knows she must put the mental lens of her focus on winning. Not payback. Not vengeance. Not even gossip or trash talk. Everything on winning.   Not just to impress an eccentric billionaire but to pay the rent and grocery bills. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 376","Text":"Yui walks up a mountain path she recognizes and sees a woman standing at the edge of a precipice.  She reaches out to the woman. Knows something's wrong.  The woman turns to her slightly and Yui realizes she's staring at an older version of herself. Grey hair, bloodshot eyes, tears streaming down her face. Older Yui stares at younger Yui with longing. Then older Yui shakes her head, turns and jumps. Younger Yui rushes to the edge and stares down at countless bodies busted and broken over jagged rocks. All of them… her. She has sudden flashes of a life she doesn't recognize, a life where she never left Hida or pursued her dream. A life where she became a teacher like her father. None of it makes sense. She covers her face with her young hands and screams and suddenly wakes up in her bed lying in a pool of sticky, cold sweat. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 377","Text":"Misato smiles at Yui.  Maybe it wasn't a dream. Maybe it was a glimpse into another world, a world where you take a completely different path.  In one you become a vengeful, red-eyed brute and in another a coward that doesn't follow her dreams.  Yui shakes her head. I don't believe in any of that multi-world magical bullshit.  Misato scrunches her face when she hears magic. Not magic, quantum… quantum bullshit. Misato munches on peanuts and sips her beer. If it's a dream it probably has something to do with something you are moving away from, something you left behind. What do the cliffs signify? Yui remembers a moment with her grandmother. She remembers she was at a recreational center with her friends and cousins. She lost a relay race because her best friend stopped to see if their competitor was okay when he tripped and fell. Her teammate helped the boy up while another team took the lead and won the race. She was furious and they hadn't spoken for weeks. Yui remembered going to the precipice where they liked to talk hoping she would be there, but she wasn't. Her grandmother went up to see her and listened to her side of the story and sided with her friend.  \n\nYui vaguely remembered the talk. Her grandmother sat beside her, staring below at the jagged rocks, laughing nervously. You love danger… and more than danger you love winning. Always have, always will. But winning isn't everything, Yui. Tell me… what's the use of winning if you lose all your friends? Who are you going to share your victories with?  Yui laughs at this and calls her best friend weak. Her grandmother places a concerned hand on her shoulder. She's not weak. I would say she's quite the opposite to sacrifice winning to help someone in need. Empathy is what makes us human and if you lose this you are… you are just a very good machine that wins. What does it matter if you gain the world if you lose your humanity? Yui closes her eyes and knows her grandmother is right, and yet… there's something inside her that hates to lose, that refuses to lose, something that will drive her to win despite it all.  A thing that brings out the best and worst in her. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 378","Text":"Engines rattle and roar in an endless cacophony as Shinji messes with Yui. Everyone wants the jackpot, and she needs this money more than ever. She's been working as an assistant English teacher at a high school but it's barely enough to get by let alone fix her bike. Her bike… her bike feels sick. She used to love the sound of her bike but recently she's noticed a change, a few notes are off, and the sound just doesn't travel through her body the way it used to. All these engines singing their unique song and her bike singing something strange and off. She needs the prize money, and the sponsorship of a billionaire wouldn't be so bad either. Last thing she'll do is let this fool disrupt her focus. She smiles at him after he levels an insult at her and threatens to run her off the road. Yui meets his gaze. You'll try, but you'll crash and burn just as soon as you do. She says it with the weight and certainty of a curse. Shinji tells her she should stay out of this one and let the men race. She knows what he trying to do. He's trying to disrupt her. Get in her head. Change the vision of victory in her mind. He tells her the race is his. She flashes a smile. Not while I'm alive.

The weight that sits in her chest melts away, allowing for one starving breath. The scent of sweat and dusty linen is willed from her mind, replaced with memories of tomatoes and fresh soil. Her feet take her down the hall, heels clicking, echoing into an expanse of shadows. She does not allow herself to see the stains on the walls or the fracture in the window's pane. She could draw them from memory but, for this moment, they cease to exist.<br><br>As Sally reaches the end of the hall, she peers into a patient's room, illuminated by a blade of moonlight cutting across the floor. A young girl, sitting atop the bed, flinches at the oncoming shadow. Only as Sally walks into the moonlight does the girl release her grip on a bundle of sheets. Sally offers a sympathetic smile to her… the Anxious Girl. The asylum's file lists her name as Marion but the staff have codes for each patient. The Catatonic Boy, the Sweaty Codger, the Anxious Girl. Everything they are summarized into two words.<br><br>Sally sits on the edge of the bed, braiding the Anxious Girl's dry, brittle hair. Did you visit the community room today? The Anxious Girl hugs her pillow. I stayed here. A light moan carries through the hall, the first indication that peace will soon be broken. Sally does her best to ignore it, weaving one strand of hair over another. Did you know that room has a chair by the window? You can see the robins building a nest in the trees. The Anxious Girl looks to the hallway, her shoulders tensing as she listens to the distant moan. Sally gently rubs the girl's shoulder, wordlessly offering her sympathy. They sit for a short time until a scream carries through the hallway. "},{"Title":"Memory 907","Text":"Sally marches down the hall to the source of the scream. Patients, each in their own rooms, react, an interlude of cries and shrieks joining in, accompanied by the thumping of a head slamming into a wall. The volume builds, louder and more chaotic, until finally, as if reaching a crescendo, a patient howls. Sally rushes into a room, moving towards a hideously scarred woman, restrained to the bed, whose scream slowly dies into soft, mirthful laughter. Did you enjoy the song, sweet nurse? I call it Concerto of Lunatics.<br><br>The asylum is wide awake now, alive, anxious, the scattered shrieks and moans of patients ricocheting through the halls. Sally's chest tightens, as she struggles to breathe. Why… why must you rile them? The Broken Woman smiles beneath the swath of bandages over her scarred face. Through two small holes, mismatched eyes—blue and orange—sparkle. Oh, sweet nurse, what are the jesters for if not a laugh? Sally knows to step away, knows there is nothing to gain from arguing, yet she cannot restrain herself. They are humans and, sick as they may be, they deserve sympathy. This is a line Sally has told herself many times over the years, though that is all it has become—a line; a series of carefully rehearsed words pushed through chapped lips. Perhaps this is why the Broken Woman chuckles as if trading quips with a friend. They deserve sympathy? Most have contributed nothing but pain, and the others have contributed nothing at all. "},{"Title":"Memory 908","Text":"Sally makes no attempt to suppress her disgust as she looks at the Broken Woman's smile. You would criticize your fellow patients for bringing nothing to this world, yet what have you provided? The Broken Woman awkwardly sits up on her bed, pulling at her restraints like a restless marionette. I have provided more to this world than a thousand missionaries. When I saw sickness, I did not coddle it, feed it, wipe the tears from its eyes—I cleansed it! The Broken Woman sees she has Sally's attention. If we want humanity to survive, we must be its custodians, sweet nurse. And yet… we have allowed an infection to fester—the evidence pervading these walls. The Broken Woman pauses, allowing her point to settle. Shrieks and moans from the mentally insane echo through the halls.<br><br>Sally feels her nerves tighten with each chaotic noise that comes her way. She has little desire to argue, yet duty compels. Are you not within these walls too? Would that not make you part of the infection? The Broken Woman smiles as if expecting this question. I am the solution, condemned to the halls of the infected. Like you, I was a nurse. But I served not the patients but the greater good. With one simple injection I removed the weak from the gene pool. I watched them in their death throes, knowing my actions were backed by honest science so few have the strength to trust. And do you know what the courts called me for following logic? Insane! "},{"Title":"Memory 909","Text":"The days pass, but Sally's unsure how many. She always finds herself back in the asylum, tending to the frantic, the violent, the feeble. Down the hall, the Bad Man has slipped his restraints again. Like a wolf, he shows no motive but to prowl for the weak, and it appears he's found his prey. He drags the naked body of the Rancid Son by the ankles. Blood spills from the Son's head. Sally does not know if the man is dead. Calling for help, she sprints down the hall with a syringe filled of sedatives. There are no other nurses to come to her aid. Financial restrictions have seen to that. She considers that she is running to her death this time, but there is something involuntary in her movements, as if she has become a spectator. The Bad Man lets go of the Rancid Son's ankles and turns his attention to Sally. He fails to notice Harvey Kavanagh, the plump orderly, round the corner behind him. Harvey slams The Bad Man into the floor as he's done to so many patients. Sally jabs a sedative into the Bad Man's neck. The Bad Man sags in place and with a look of bewilderment falls to the ground.<br><br>The decrepit hall is silent. Sally looks over the scene at her feet. Kavanagh's sizable frame hefts up and down as he catches his breath, thick arm slung over The Bad Man who rests peacefully. The Rancid Son, either unconscious or dead, lies beneath them with Kavanagh's boot pressed against his nostril. The smear of blood from his head goes on for thirty feet down the hall before curling into an adjacent room. Sally laughs to stop herself from screaming. "},{"Title":"Memory 910","Text":"Sally finds herself in the Broken Woman's room. The mismatched eyes of the Broken Woman appear sympathetic as the sunlight shimmers over them, yet she speaks with sharpened words. Shame about that bloody disturbance yesterday. Boys like that are made a certain way… not built for civil society. The big, brutish one, well, it is as plain as the skin on his face. And the other, oh, the other one hides it well. But have you looked at his family name? That will explain everything.<br><br>Sally wills herself to think of a gentle lake, lilies and—no… all she can see are the grimy asylum walls and bloody bandages. There are no gentle breezes to distract her, only the Broken Woman's voice prodding deeper. Did you not have a husband, sweet nurse? I recall the newspaper article… hand to heart, my dear, I cried at his unfortunate death. You would have had beautiful babies. To now be here, a widow of pure genes, serving the filth of the world—such a turn of events.<br><br>Sally gets up, leaving a bandage half-wrapped. Her feet shuffle imprecisely as she moves for the door. She tries to push her thoughts away, knows she shouldn't think it, but—it is such cruelty. Her love was pure, her husband pure, and those who live in these halls are anything but. Yet these sick, twisted beasts, receive the care and attention deserved to the man she lost.<br><br>Her throat catches on each breath. Her vision blurs. She wants to run but knows it's no use. No matter where she goes, she always finds herself back in these halls. With swirling thoughts, one stark realization breaks through: it is not she who keeps the insane confined to these halls, but the insane who confine her.<br><br>She falls to the unforgiving floor. "},{"Title":"Memory 911","Text":"A lush green field dotted with salmon-colored lilies and patches of pine trees surround the lake. The colors are more vibrant than Sally remembers, and though it smells of fresh rain, the sky is clear. Andrew sits next to her on a blanket, his blonde hair nearly white in the sun. She wears the dress he had bought her. A symbol of my love, he had written on the card, and for a man of few words it meant many.<br><br>He wipes the grass stains from his calloused hands and turns to Sally. We should get home. The lake will still be here tomorrow. A cold breeze sweeps through the meadow, bringing with it the scent of sweat and dusty linen. She grips his wrist with both hands. Just one more minute, please. One more.<br><br>She hears saws ripping through lumber, the sound heightening with each violent slash. Tighter, she holds Andrew's wrist, pressing her head into his shoulder and bracing herself. An immense tree slams to the ground behind her, sending twigs and dirt into the air. One after another, they come down in booming, ground-shaking jolts. Sally coughs through a cloud of dust, keeping her grip on Andrew the entire time.<br><br>A bead of blood trickles down his arm, coming to rest on her finger. She looks up to see her husband's skull broken open, spilling blood and chunks of brain. One stark white eye looks out from the carnage, focused intently on her. We would have had beautiful babies, Sally.<br><br>She collapses into the crimson muck of his chest and cries. The skin on her hands flakes away, turning to dust. She loses her grip on him. Everything she was, down to the dress she wore, decays, blown away in the wind.<br><br>The sweaty hands of Kavanagh shake her as she awakes on the asylum floor.

Occasional moans and shouts carry from nearby rooms, short bursts of mania or terror that emerge and intermingle: The Concerto of Lunatics.<br><br>Sally enters the Anxious Girl's room and sits at the foot of her bed. The girl flinches but, after a second's pause, lifts herself up. Illuminated under moonlight, she offers a timid yet warm smile. Sally takes three strands of the girl's hair and begins to weave a braid. Did you see the robins today? But Sally doesn't wait for the girl's answer. Another day hiding, wasn't it? And what about the robins? They will be dead by the time you leave this room.<br><br>The girl's shoulders tense and Sally feels herself do the same. She takes a deep breath, attempting to calm herself. As she parts the hair back from the Anxious Girl's skull, she spies tiny, writhing creatures. An infestation of lice crawls through the girl's hair. Sally pulls her hand back and slaps the girl across her face. Filthy!<br><br>Their eyes lock, confusion and startlement among them both. Tears trickle down the Anxious Girl's helpless face, wet chin trembling. Sally takes a step back. She thinks to apologize, to explain the stress she's been under, but something in her refuses. Filthy girl! She storms from the room. "},{"Title":"Memory 913","Text":"Sally, her face emotionally void, sits next to the Broken Woman's bed. She finds herself more and more in this position, listening to the woman ramble. The Broken Woman fidgets with her restraints, fixated on an unscarred piece of skin at the base of her hand. Purification comes in many forms. We must all make sacrifices. She curls a finger inwards and scratches at the clean piece of skin until it's torn off. For the most grotesque offenders—the genetic abominations—we must take extreme measures. Otherwise, you get… well, the results surround you.<br><br>Sally sits motionless, her tired eyes the only indication that she's conscious. The Broken Woman speaks as if chatting with a friend over tea. Do you know what I could do? I could tell you the ingredients for my special injection… the one I used on my patients. A quick little prick and they'll writhe as if a purifying fire burns within. A fitting way to deal with inhuman filth, wouldn't you say? Are you hearing me, sweet nurse? You don't have to be their servant anymore."},{"Title":"Memory 914","Text":"Sally feels the asylum closing in on her. Whispers of paranoid lunatics spill through the cracks. She wonders how long she can walk this hallway, questions if it ever ends. She passes the Catatonic Boy in his wheelchair, staring deep into the walls. He gazes in her direction though his eyes look through her. Has the trial begun? He lets out a scream, pausing as if having startled himself, then laughs.<br><br>Harvey Kavanagh, the Fat Orderly, emerges from a patient's room and gives her a smile. The skin on his neck dangles as he moves, glistening with sweat. A thick coat of hair covers his arms and curls over the collar of his shirt. His eyes move from Sally's feet upwards, pausing on her chest until he realizes she's watching him. His eyes dart to examine the floor as he nervously licks his mouth.<br><br>Ahead, the Foul Girl skips gracefully, enjoying her first day out of restraints in a month. She hums a pleasant tune, tracing her hand over the wall. As Sally approaches, the Girl tilts her head forward. She lets out a long, guttural sound, heaving her diaphragm until vomit splashes onto the floor. Content with herself, she smiles and skips on.<br><br>Sally continues, giving no thought to cleaning the mess. She sees the Shoeless Imbecile sitting by the broom closet. Thick strands of blood drip from his mouth. With precise rhythm he slams his jaw into the doorframe six times, digs at his gums, and pulls out a tooth. He peers at Sally as if she's the strangest thing he's ever seen.<br><br>Sally looks out at the hallway, stretching on forever. She stops, accepting what she's tried to suppress: the sickness can grow no more. "},{"Title":"Memory 915","Text":"Sally fills the syringe as the Broken Woman instructed. Thick, dark liquid swirls within, a night sky void of stars. The helpless anxiety that crippled her vanishes under a sea of calm.<br><br>Though her heels click with each step, she feels as if she floats; as if everything she's to do has been determined, requiring only the gentlest breeze to push her forward. She sees the sickness clearly. It has infected all. But the most hideous, is the one who refuses to face it; the dog that doesn't know it's a dog. And so, she makes her way to the Broken Woman's room.<br><br>Strange how, for all the woman's wisdom, she is blind to her impurities. Though she removes the blemishes from her skin, she fails to judge the mismatched eyes that gaze at her in the mirror. But no amount of carving can remove genetics.

Reading these notes, I decipher several voices who I am aptly calling the unknown few who like myself had a fixation with the Entity and who like myself had an ability to experience the memories encoded in the fog. I will include my past scribblings and number them as best as I can, referring to them as notes obscura, or just obscura, to try and piece together how long I've actually been here. I think I may have found my first ramblings amongst the half-destroyed journals of the unknown occupants who struggled with infinite possibilities of whiling away the time except the one they probably missed the most. The one I miss the most—friendship, companionship, sitting with my father drinking whiskey and watching the Ancients swim across the night sky, or just losing time with a friend in a hearty conversation about the merits of art, music, laughter and stories. All I have now are the memories of others. Second-hand experiences that constantly remind me of things lost and half-remembered."},{"Title":"OBSCURA.

Eight or nine of them from the distinct voices I deciphered in the manifold journals I read with surprising interest and alacrity. Some of these unknown prisoners shared my unusual penchant for beer, whiskey and stories of the macabre. Others seemed to be raving lunatics writing not journals but senseless notes—notes from the absurd I call them—strange musings and endless contradictions about places and characters observed and consciously or unconsciously improperly described. These notes from the absurd seem to start with unintelligible gibberish are quite different from anything I've seen or read, as though written by someone driven by madness or some other motive to undermine any attempt to make sense of this world. Along with the notes I found illustrations and survivor statements from police files and thousands of short stories in a dark chamber in the basement.  They had been piled up and set ablaze but quickly extinguished with some sort of a putrid, rotting sludge. I cleaned the chamber and stacked all the stories in piles to go through and organize at a later date. For the time being I see no reason to remove them from what I am now calling the Chamber of Blood. "},{"Title":"SURVIVOR STATEMENT.

I can't remember which one of us figured how to do it… but we realized that the stories were codes to pass on coordinates of locations of interest for some group or cult or whatever. We decoded a few other stories and came to the conclusion that these people were sending encrypted locations of places where they believe there would be ghosts. We didn't buy any of that paranormal crap and we were just having fun drinking and decoding the stories and looking up the places on satellite maps. But when the coordinates of one story turned out to be close to us, we thought we could check out the place for fun. Adrien rented a car and we headed up to what was left of the crumbling asylum. There was nothing but overgrown ruins. But I remember this unnatural black fog and it was like we were at the asylum but some other version of it. It was really strange. And that's when we saw this thing… this giant samurai with a demon mask lurking about as though it had stepped out of one world and into another. He killed Mia first. I don't remember what happened exactly… I just saw… I saw her head thump and tumble across the ground. I don't remember much… I remember crawling out of the fog and that demon or apparition or whatever that thing was couldn't follow me…  like it was blocked by something invisible. Not long after a man who called himself Hans and who identified himself as a detective arrived and asked me questions about what I had seen. He took some notes and seemed a bit strange. Then when he heard the sirens approaching, he disappeared just like that. When the police arrived, the fog was gone leaving only the… the… hacked remains of my friends.

A fan had sought them out after having watched one of their episodes about interdimensional overlaps which Haddie could sense, feel and even explore if her focus was right and she was able to 'tune in' as she so often described her process.  \n\nAs their luck would have it this mysterious benefactor had funded an entire expedition all over the world, giving her brother and uncle access to countless remote and classified areas of known paranormal activity and unexplainable disappearances. \n\nHaddie sipped her tea, listening to the villagers speak a language that reminded her of her disappeared father, and she suddenly heard a familiar voice and Quebecois accent that stood out from the rest calling out her name.  \n\nA moment later Stefan entered the dhaba with Jordan. “I found the site of the massacre,” Stefan said. “Finish your tea, and let's get outta here!”  \n\nHaddie sprang to her feet and followed her uncle and brother into the scorching hot day."},{"Title":"Evil Eyes 2","Text":"Chamber of Blood.

Most stay away from this place like the plague.” He stared at the older teens as if they were mad. “You should have returned to the hotel like your uncle. Nothing here but the eyes, and they're probably watching us right now.”  \n\nHaddie and Jordan didn't answer or want to explain that their uncle didn't have the stomach for adventure, that he was more of a producer and that he was trying to finish off a horror novel he'd been working on for the last ten years. Ignoring the guide's nervous ramblings, Haddie studied the white stone bricks of the ruined fort and the surrounding caves with a strange feeling that they were being watched.  \n\nThe guide said, “The official story is a unit of British soldiers died fighting a band of thugees.”   \n\n“And the unofficial story?” Haddie turned to him. The guide stared at her for a long moment. “The unofficial story is they turned their rifles and swords against each other. Something in these caves drove them mad.”  \n\nHaddie absorbed this and closed her eyes while Jordan filmed the ruins and the caves. Calming her heart and silencing her mind, she began to hear the rising screams and cries of people being butchered. When she opened her eyes again, she could see the scintillating orange residual memories of British soldiers cutting down thuggee rebels.  \n\nOne thug seemed to be holding something important in his hands as he escaped the massacre. She walked through residual memories and approached the thug, starring at a piece of broken pillar in his hand. The thug desperately clambered over the rocks and rubble, charging into a nearby cave with the soldiers in hot pursuit.  \n\nJordan stepped up behind her. “Did you see anything?” \n\nHaddie nodded and pointed at the cave the thug had run into.  \n\nThe guide raised his eyebrows. “And that's my cue to go,” he said, turning his back on the siblings. “Not that I think you're both crazy… which I do… but I need to get home before my wife realizes I'm gone. It's my day to make rotis and pick up the kids from school.”  \n\nHaddie and Jordan watched the guide disappear down the rocky, sun-baked valley. Then they turned and approached the gaping mouth of the cave. For a long moment they stared into the darkness without saying a word. Jordan turned on the flashlight of his cellphone and just as they prepared to enter, they heard the crunch of stone behind them. Brother and sister turned slowly to face the barrel of a rifle. "},{"Title":"Evil Eyes 3","Text":"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 3.<br><br>Three men speaking an ancient, unknown language forced Haddie and Jordan through the dark and seemingly endless cave with flickering flashlights to illuminate the way. Somehow these captors knew Haddie had a gift and were barking orders for her in broken English to lead them to the place where the thuggee rebel had hidden the relic. She didn't recognize her captors but it wasn't the first time someone had forced her to find something with her special abilities.  \n\nHaddie followed a trail of residual memories—memories and whispers only she could see and hear. She could sense they were walking through an 'overlap' of realities which heightened and reinforced her abilities in an inexplicable way. She followed the scintillating orange trail and froze when the residual soldiers suddenly disappeared. Then she started when the soldiers blinked back into existence and she heard desperate screams as something she couldn't make out attacked them.   \n\n“What is it?” one of her captors asked.  \n\n“She's seeing something,” Jordan said. “Let her do her thing.”   \n\n“This better not be a trick!”  \n\nHaddie watched the indiscernible creature rip the soldiers into an unrecognizable mess of flesh and gore. The creature then snatched the thug and dragged him screaming through a series of interconnecting tunnels. She chased after the fading memory, entering a small cavern as she watched the thug release the relic as the creature dragged him into a smaller tunnel that she imagined led to a feeding den.   \n\nMemories burned out like dying embers to reveal a cavern of human bones piled over thick rotting sludge. She winced at the stench of fermented organs and fluids and waved a cloud of flies away from her face. Near one pile of bones was a corpse, still warm, flayed from head to toe, eyes missing, mouth transfixed in an agonizing scream. The captors stared at the corpse for a long moment before one prodded Haddie with the barrel of his rifle. \n\n “What the hell did this?” One of their captors murmured in disbelief.  \n\n“There must be a bend in reality here.” Another captor offered as an explanation. Haddie noted that what she called an 'overlap' these men called a 'bend.' It was clear that they had an understanding of other dimensions and that somehow this piece of column was more than just a relic. \n\n“Where is it?” The leader prodded Haddie. “Where's the relic!” \n\nHaddie took a moment, then pointed at a pile of bones. “But it could also be in there…” She motioned toward the tunnel that led to the feeding den.  \n\n“Check the bones,” one captor ordered the siblings.    \n\nJordan and Haddie kneeled in the sticky sludge and rummaged through the bones as the leader turned toward the shadowy tunnel.  He inched close to the opening and flashed a blade of light inside. While the other two captors were dealing with flies and covering their noses, Haddie found the jagged piece of column and stealthily slid it over to Jordan.  \n\nA sudden chatter of teeth and hissing made them all turn to the leader. He searched the darkness with a beam of light that suddenly momentary revealed a grotesque creature with a face covered by dozens if not hundreds of glowing red eyes.  \n\nThe leader brought the beam back to the face as the creature hissed and revealed a mouth filled with needle-like teeth. An instant later the creature grabbed the flashlight and pulled the leader inside the den.  \n\nThe other captors stumbled, dropped things and fired stupidly into the darkness. Haddie instantly grabbed a fallen flashlight, looked at her brother with wide, desperate eyes and yelled for him to— \n\n“RUN!” "},{"Title":"Evil Eyes 4","Text":"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell.

She had no idea what she was going to do next. She narrowed her gaze, waiting. Teeth suddenly chattered and a hundred red eyes bore down on her.  \n\nHaddie inched back and fell to the ground beside a skeleton holding a kukri in one hand and a revolver in the other. She instantly wrenched the weapons out of its boney hands and clambered to trembling feet.  \n\nThe creature approached slowly, hissing and chattering, its terrible eyes fixated on her. She stared at long arms and fingers with claws like knives. She lifted her arm and aimed the revolver at its head. Then she pulled the trigger and— \n\nNothing happened.  \n\nA hundred eyes stared down at the revolver, then back at her.  \n\n“Shit.” \n\nThe creature hissed, then attacked with a roar. Haddie evaded. Terrible claws swished overhead and hit the wall. Bits of rock and stone rained over her.  \n\nCovered in debris, she sprang up and ran with the creature in pursuit. She turned in the gathering dust and instinctively felt the attack before it came as she often did. With one quick thrust of her arm, the blade of the kukri severed the hand. The creature shrieked something terrible.   \n\nHaddie seized the opportunity to severe the head but the creature lunged away and the blade hit the stone wall. The kukri vibrated out of her hand and she dove to the ground as the creature charged her.  \n\nTumbling away, Haddie instinctively grabbed a slab of stone. The creature attacked and missed, hitting the wall. Without hesitation Haddie smashed the slab over its bewildered head with a terrible crunching sound she wouldn't soon forget.  \n\nThe creature collapsed and Haddie, adrenalin rushing, bludgeoned the head and eyes. When there was nothing left but a sticky, warm pulp she released the gore-covered stone and fell back on her haunches to gather herself. But no sooner did she relax than she heard the rising crescendo of chattering teeth echoing through the darkness.  \n\nWith an almost defeated sigh, Haddie staggered to her feet. White fear flashed through her mind as the chattering and hissing grew louder and louder. Teeth clenched as thousands of red eyes flared up in the inky blackness of the cave. She backed away slowly, then spun on her heals and ran! "},{"Title":"Evil Eyes 5","Text":"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 5.<br><br>Haddie charged toward the mouth of the cave with millions of eyes and chattering teeth on her heels. She felt the swipes at her back but never wavered. She vaulted wildly out the mouth just as one creature lunged at her. Haddie tumbled out of the cave as the creature hit an invisible barrier where the overlap of dimensions ended. She turned to see the dark mouth of the cave fill with scathing red eyes.  \n\nJordan stepped up behind her. “Helly Haddie, does it again,” he said with a laugh.   \n\nHaddie gave her brother a dirty look. “Don't call me that,” she said curtly. Even though he had meant no harm, it was a name along with 'The Harbinger of Hell' children used to call her because bad luck, strange things and unexplainable accidents seemed to follow her. Years of therapy gave her the courage to accept her abilities and to boldly call her series the Harbinger of Hell.   \n\nExhausted, Haddie sat on a sun-baked stone and watched the red eyes slowly disappear from the gloom of the cave. “Did you catch the creature on your shirt cam?” \n\nJordan shook his head as he sat beside her. She didn't think he would as creatures or relics from other worlds didn't register and often left blurs or glitches.  \n\nJordan sighed and handed over the relic they had recovered. “What do you make of it?”  \n\nHaddie held it and felt great misery. In her mind's eye she saw cloaked figures hiding pieces of the same pillar in another world. She shrugged and kept what she had seen to herself. Then she pulled out her cellphone and handed it to Jordan. He centered her in the frame and indicated he was filming.   \n\nHaddie cleared her throat, mopped her forehead of sweat and soot, looked into the lens, and proceeded to address her online followers:  \n\n“My name is Haddie and I was born with a wonderful curse. All my life I've attracted strange and unusual things, and when I was twelve, I realized I was able to acquire insight to unexplainable events and otherworldly places.”  \n\nShe took a moment to calm her racing heart. She swallowed her fear, remembered she had a series to sell, and forced energy and pep into her voice. “What do you need to know about India? It's where my father grew up and it's where I am today to explore the urban legends of this amazing country.”  \n\nHaddie took a moment to find her words.   \n\n“Our adventure begins in Northern India at a strange place locals call The Eyes or the Valley of Evil Eyes where hundreds have disappeared or died including a unit of British soldiers in the 1800s. What happened to these soldiers? Where did they disappear to? And is there any merit to the accounts of a cave-dwelling demon with eyes around its head that burn right through the soul?” \n\nHaddie stared meditatively into the camera and wanted to say 'yes' to every one of her questions but decided it was better to leave them up to interpretation. After a dramatic pause, she finished, “Take a look at what we discovered. Judge the evidence for yourself… and see if there is any truth to the Evil Eyes of the Himalayas.”   "}]}]},"Tome07":{"Vignettes":[{"VignetteId":"Tome07_Bill","Name":"The Long Way Home","SubTitle":"Memories: Bill Overbeck","Entries":[{"Title":"Memory 776","Text":"Overbeck staggers out of his house with a canvas bag still trying to process the last few hours of his life.

He wanted to sleep, just sleep, but he ordered his eyes to stay open and spotted the syringe rolling over the antiseptic floor. He remembers jerking his arm out, grabbing the syringe and smashing it into his heart. Or was it his arm? Or maybe both? He doesn't remember anymore. Doesn't matter. All that matters is he made it out of that hell alive. He shakes his throbbing head and clambers over a barricade blocking an alley. Winds his way through the burning city toward the market.

Dust floats through the air, settles on her skin, more real than anything she ever believed. A lifetime of faith, security, crumbles. She feels unsteady, the only certainty in her mind that she must leave this place.

She swings, droplets of blood sprinkling to the floor. Spasms of pain, as skin tears off, hanging on pale threads. Braces herself and whips again, again, till the crimson pools. ATONE!

So much to read… and yet I find myself drawn to the scribblings and renditions of the unknown creator I'm calling the Mad Designer. Journals filled with the wild sketches and musings of people I imagine are caught in other parts of this living dimension--people juxtaposed with other Terra worlds and timelines that make little or no sense to who they are or where they come from. The illustrations and notes are foolish, absurd and quite contradictory, and yet they bring moments of levity to my life which does the soul good. I suppose it's a form of absurd escapism I turn to when I'm not reading the more traditional stories. Interestingly enough, I found seventeen versions of a story featuring a killer named Evan written by seventeen versions of the same author from the omniverse. Seventeen similar stories with sometimes subtle, sometimes significant differences. What I find particularly interesting is how the stories are written as fiction in one world and non-fiction in another. It reminds me of Universus Alveo… a theory that suggests that the human mind might very well be equipped with a powerful networking mechanism that reaches out to other worlds for wisdom and knowledge from our other-selves. Some can use their minds in this way and others can't. The theory suggests that those who have experienced trauma in their formative years detach from their reality, allowing them to explore other realities and worlds with relative ease. Artists like magicians and shamans see small things in the big, unexplainable endless dream that is the omniverse and they bring these ideas or insights back to entertain, enlighten and inspire the world. Fiction in one world, non-fiction in another. Everything is real, or nothing is. And here in the Chamber of Blood there are countless horror stories of every variety.  So many that it seems to me that one of the unknown prisoners was collecting these stories as a way to discover more about their imprisonment, the Entity and the terrible screams coming from the surrounding abyss. Whether this true or not, I'm not sure, but what I do know is I spent the whole night reading my favorite stories out loud like my father used to do by the fireplace. And the entire time I couldn't help but wonder… How?  How could anyone have accessed and assembled such a rich collection of notes, journals and stories? I have no immediate answer, but I suspect by the texture and density of the fog that I may be in a place as complex, mysterious and misunderstood as a black hole—a living, breathing, all-consuming black hole, the serpent of infinity that gorges on its tail, that eats itself endlessly as it spirals downward into the cosmic, Fibonacci stew that is life incomprehensible."},{"Title":"Arcus 8282","Text":"Dozens of severed heads in the den and I'm not sure how they got there.

Beneath the Ruins 1.<br><br>Stefan sipped his cold Turkish coffee as he read over his early-morning efforts toward a short story he hoped to share on his blog. He read the opening lines and decided they could be stronger. With a sigh, he tore the yellow page from the legal pad, crumpled it into a ball and tossed it into a growing pile of false-starts in the middle of the opulent, black and burgundy hotel room. He slammed the desk, frustrated, and wanted to write something fun and original for his blog, yet nothing came to him. The latest episode sponsored by their mysterious benefactor had his production team investigate ancient tombs in South-West, Turkey. Not so much him. But his niece and nephew, who had tougher nerves for the macabre.  \n\nStefan much preferred a safe and cozy hotel room where he could raid the mini-bar and see to the logistics of the show.  It wasn't that he didn't like adventure. It was more that he didn't like graves, tombs or places that felt dark, creepy and dangerous.  Haddie had once suggested that he wrote horror stories as a kind of therapy to work out his fears and anxieties of the unknown. She was half right. The other half was that he simply liked to be alone—alone with all the characters and voices chattering in his head, voices that demanded to be heard and set to paper.  \n\nNow the voices were compelling him to write a vampire story. Their benefactor claimed that there had been a village of real vampires in ancient Anatolia that had been hidden from the rest of the world. According to the intelligence provided, vampires weren't fictional monsters but actual intra-dimensional creatures that had once tried to overrun the world. They had been defeated by an unknown group of mystical warriors. Somehow the few creatures that had survived managed to erase themselves from history by warping and weaving whatever memory of them was left into exaggerated myths and legends.  \n\nStefan found this theory of myths and legends and parallel worlds interesting if not intriguing.  \n\nVampires real.  \n\nActually, real.  \n\nNothing like the movies, but real nevertheless.  \n\nOne theory he had just finished reading online suggested that everything created or imagined existed somewhere in the 'Garden of Infinity.'  In other words, stories and characters came from a real place in the infinite landscape that was the omniverse.  \n\nThe theory went on to suggest that artists had somehow unlocked their third eye and were able to see into other realities.  An idea, a vision, or a dream, according to the theory, was the pineal gland seeing into the infinite for truth, wisdom, inspiration. The brain, then, was a quantum computer that could network with the infinite. It was a nice idea. It meant that his most cherished characters from his favorite books… were somehow… somewhere… real. A sudden knock at the door startled him out of his quantum musings.  \n\n\"Mr. Roi… Your lunch is ready.\"  \n\nLunchtime already and Stefan still didn't have his story. He rose lazily in his bathrobe, hoping Jordan and Haddie had better luck finding the unmarked graves they had set out to find. He imagined his niece and nephew were enjoying the sun while filming the ruins and enjoying the peanut butter and banana sandwiches he had prepared for them."},{"Title":"Beneath the Ruins 2","Text":"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 2.<br><br>\"Move away from the casket!\" A middle-aged woman with blonde hair and blue eyes dressed in a black suit pointed a revolver at Haddie and Jordan. Haddie dropped her shovel, sighed, exchange a look with her brother and stepped away from the bolted casket.   \n\n\"Who do you work for?\" Haddie asked, eying the woman.  \n\n\"That, my dear, does not concern you.\" \n\nJordan shook his head. \"I don't think you should open it.\"  \n\n\"Shut-up!\"  \n\n\"My brother's right.\" Haddie pointed at the symbols etched all in the rotten wood of the casket. \"It's a warning of some kind… whatever's in there… is meant to stay in there.\"  She scrutinized the half-crescent and three dots and wondered what they meant. They didn't resemble any of the other symbols she had come across in the last few months.  \n\n\"Superstitious nonsense!\" The woman yelled, aimed the revolver at the bolt and pulled the trigger. A report echoed through the ruins and the surrounding forest. \n\nHaddie wondered if their guide and translator had heard them. He probably didn't even take notice or didn't care. He refused to follow them near the tombs, called them ignorant tourists, and said he would stay by the car texting his friends until they returned. The woman pulled the trigger repeatedly until the bolt clanged off and hit the ground with a thud.  \n\n\"I hope he calls the police,\" Jordan whispered to Haddie.  \n\n\"I wouldn't count on it…\"  \n\nThe woman examined the casket carefully. Haddie and Jordan inched backward as she struggled to yank the lid open. As Haddie cautiously backed away, she figured the woman worked for the same secret society that had now interfered with several of her investigations.  \n\nShe didn't know much about them, but from what she had gathered by overhearing a few of their goons in Egypt was that they were searching for hidden knowledge—knowledge they believed would help humanity transcend to another plane of existence.   \n\n\"Please…\" Haddie cautioned. \"Don't open it until we know what the symbol means.\"  \n\nThe goon scoffed and, with a labored scream, yanked the lid open to reveal— \n\nNothing.  \n\nNothing but a strange black mist.  \n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said. \"It's supposed to be here… the book…\"   \n\nThe goon's eyes narrowed. Frustration creased her face as black mist suddenly rose and spiralled into her mouth and nose as though it were alive.  \n\nHaddie and Jordan stepped out of the grave. \n\nThe woman gagged, coughed and collapsed. There in the dirt, she jerked and twitched in all kinds of unnatural directions, screaming and shrieking as the mist reshaped her body into something indescribably grotesque. Her veins stood out thick and black in her neck. Her hands smashed the ground, and she went into hysteric convulsions as though being burned alive.  Then, with a blood-curdling scream, her body went limp and silent. \n\nHaddie repressed a cry of horror. She felt a cold prickle run down her spine as she stared at the scene in disbelief. What was going on? What strange mist could do such a thing to a person?  Was it some kind of ancient poison… some kind of toxic vapor… or was it something worse…  \n\n\"Well… you don't see that every day, do you?\" Jordan said flatly. \"I seriously wish I got that on my phone.\"  \n\nHaddie sighed. \"Is she dead?\" \n\n\"Dead as a tomb.\"  \n\nHaddie didn't find him funny. Not in the least. He was scared. She could tell by his desperate attempt to use humor to hide his fear. He was just about to crack another joke when the creature suddenly twitched back to life.  \n\nStartled, Haddie gasped and pulled at Jordan's t-shirt, saying, \"We need to get out of here.\" But just as she stepped back, the creature turned to face them with blood-red eyes and a jaw protruding like a snout with teeth that seemed to be growing underneath stretched skin.  \n\n\"Oh shit!\" Haddie blurted. She lost her footing, and fell to the ground with her brother.  The creature that had once been a woman roared at them, revealing two massive fangs like carving knives."},{"Title":"Beneath the Ruins 3","Text":"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 3.<br><br>\"This way!\" Haddie yelled, leading Jordan through the shadow and light spilling through the forest canopy. She could hear the creature shrieking as it hunted them with unnatural speed and resolve. Spotting an outcrop of jagged rocks, she quickly yanked her brother into hiding.  \n\n\"Aren't vampires supposed to explode in sunlight?\" Jordan asked.  \"I mean, isn't that what's supposed to happen!? Doesn't it know it's supposed to be dead?\"  \n\nHaddie instantly placed a finger by his quivering lips as she heard footfalls approaching. She repressed an urge to look at the creature. Instead, she listened. She could hear the clattering and hissing coming from its hungry jaws. She could hear the crunch of stones and the distinct snap of twigs as the creature searched for them. Then the footfalls seemed to change direction, growing fainter and fainter until all she heard was the chirping of insects.  \n\nHaddie heaved a shuddering breath.  \n\nJordan gulped and swallowed a lump in his throat, saying, \"We should have respected the warning.\"   \n\n\"If that's what it was… a warning…\"   \n\n\"What else could it be?\" \n\n\"I don't know… What I do know is… we've released something foul into the world.\"   \n\n\"And by foul you mean the vampire and not gas,\" Jordan said with a smirk. \"Just clarifying.\"  \n\n\"Not funny.\" \n\n\"A little funny.\" \n\n\"No. Not even a little.\"  \n\nHaddie risked moving beyond the rocks. She glanced apprehensively, half expecting the creature to hurl itself at them. When nothing happened, she stood and, slowly and quietly, led Jordan back toward their guide.   \n\nAs she pushed her way through the woods, she couldn't help but notice the similarities between all the symbols she had seen at the last few investigation sites. They were unlike anything she had ever seen before and she had discovered them in completely different parts of the world. India. Africa. Portugal. England. Paris. And now…  Turkey.   \n\nHaddie couldn't help but feel something was amiss. She broke the silence, saying, \"We're being pulled into something far more complex than we've been led to believe. Almost like… we're being used…\" \n\n\"Used? For what? Who cares about a bunch of bozos from Montreal who release foul things into the world?\" \n\nHaddie shook her head, gave him a grave look and answered, \"I don't know. But I think it's about time we meet our mysterious—\" \n\nA twig snapped, startling the siblings.  \n\nBefore Haddie could finish her thought, the creature stood framed between two trees, dappled in sunlight.   \n\nJordan screamed in terror as the creature lunged at him, grabbing his arm and sinking its boney claws into his skin. With a mighty roar, the creature hurled him against a tree with a thud. Groaning, he sagged to the ground as inky blackness seeped down over his vision. \n\nHaddie thought quickly, spotting a fallen branch on the ground.  \n\nThe creature inched closer to Jordan, staring at him as though he were a steak.  It kneeled before him and prepared to sink its fangs into Jordan's neck to satiate its red thirst. Just as it opened its gaping mouth, a resounding yell interrupted it. \n\nThe creature hissed and turned just in time to receive a branch across the face. It fell to the side, then scrambled to its feet, locking eyes with Haddie. \n\nHaddie backed away slowly, glad she had saved her brother from certain doom, but unsure what would happen next. Then, inspired by the vampire films she had seen with her uncle Stefan, she turned the sharp side of the branch to face the creature just as it pounced on her like a lion.  \n\nThe make-shift stake hit its mark, skewering the creature straight through its monstrous heart.  \n\nThe creature shrieked something awful and collapsed to its knees, holding the stake.  \nWiping her brow, Haddie stepped away from the creature and approached her brother. But a sudden squelching sound froze her to the core. Slowly, she turned to watch the creature pull out the stake with the pulpy, dead heart still attached.  \n\nThe creature tossed the heart to the side with a mangled smile. An instant later, it pounced over Haddie, taking her to the ground. Haddie pushed and jerked under its powerful grip as it salivated and peered hungrily at the thick arterial vein pumping in her neck.  \n\nSaliva dripped down Haddie's neck slow, warm and slimy like a slug. She screamed, and then had no breath to scream and began to see not stars but…geometry… symbols… symbols she had previously discovered in The Overlap as she often called it. She didn't know what else to call what she understood to be a Venn intersection of worlds where she could see and access knowledge and memories no one else could.  \n\nHaddie closed her eyes and saw the twisted triangle symbol she had just uncovered in an ancient temple. Then she saw the strange circle slashed in half with a line that she had discovered all over the walls and floor of an abandoned asylum as though someone or something was conducting dark experiments in The Overlap on the patients. It was all very bizarre and new to her. \n\nNow, as the creature prepared to feast on her blood, Haddie wasn't seeing memories pass before her eyes but all these strange and arcane symbols that felt older than life itself—as though someone or something were trying to send her a message from The Overlap."},{"Title":"Beneath the Ruins 4","Text":"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 4.<br><br>As the creature prepared to quench its thirst, Haddie felt the end coming. Desperate hands fumbled over dirt and twigs, searching for something, anything. Then, just as the creature prepared to puncture her neck, she grabbed a rock the size of a baseball and smashed it straight through its mouth, shattering its deadly fangs.  \n\nThe creature jolted to its feet with mad agony. Pieces of bone and tooth dropped into a thick puddle of blood and saliva. Haddie turned to see Jordan moaning. He was alive, barely, nevertheless alive. Relieved, she scrambled to her feet, trying to think of a way to destroy this ancient evil once and for all.  Then she saw it— \n\nThe revolver!  \n\nHanging from the belt! \n\nWithout hesitation, she rushed up to the creature as two new white fangs pushed out the bloody remnants of the old.  Before it realized what was happening, she snatched the revolver and shot the creature point-blank in the face.   \n\nThe creature fell head over heels as Haddie unloaded the revolver into its face and body. But bullets were futile against this otherworldly apparition. Within moments the creature was clambering to its feet the whole while staring at Haddie with blood-red eyes. Nervously, she inched backward, not knowing where to go or what to do. There was nowhere to go.  Nothing she could do. This was the end. \n\nWith incredible speed and strength, the creature pounced and took Haddie to the ground. Gleaming white fangs approached her neck with malice. She jerked and kicked and screamed under its weight. She felt its warm breath inches away from the nape of her neck. Then, in her mind's eye she saw them again.  \n\nThe symbols.  \n\nAll of them.  \n\nThey swirled and flashed and then coalesced into one symbol—the symbol she had seen etched in the casket. With dawning realization, she understood. The symbol wasn't a warning but a seal—a seal to imprison this unfathomable, indescribable creature.  \n\nAs the creature prepared to gorge on her life, she managed to grab something sharp off the ground— \n\nIts broken fang! \n\nAnd with the last of her strength, she managed to etch the crescent and the three dots deep into its cheek.  \n\nSuddenly, the creature's eyes widened into great big pools of disbelief. It looked at Haddie in abject terror as it stumbled backward, desperately trying to scratch the symbol off its ghastly face.   \n\nBut it was too late.  \n\nBlack mist like acid bubbled and burned through the creature's skin. The percolating mist filled its lungs, chest and neck. The belly and chest ballooned as pressure bludgeoned the creature from within. Then, with an agonized shriek, it exploded like a cherry bomb.  \n\nCovered in gore, Haddie dragged herself beside her rousing brother. \n\n\"What did I miss?\" he groaned and sat up, leaning against the tree. He narrowed his gaze and peered through the thin red mist of blood that hung heavy in the air. \"Where's the—\"  \n\nHis voice trailed away as he noticed the shards of bone and chunks of flesh covering his clothes.  In silence, they picked off bits and pieces of the creature. Then Jordan broke the silence, saying, \"Well… this was pleasant…  pleasant as a funeral.\"  \n\nHaddie didn't respond to his stupidity. She was thinking about the symbols they had come across in their investigations.  She wondered what they meant, where they came from, and if there was something connecting all these paranormal sites they were being sent to investigate. Moreover, she wondered if their benefactor was using them in some kind of chess game against forces unknown."},{"Title":"Chamber of Blood. Ole Bloody.","Text":"This is the story the tour guide told us after showing us around the old Mad Canyon Distillery in Moonlight Bay.  She offered the adults a taste of Ole Bloody, a recipe that had been infamous during prohibition.  While we tasted the bathtub gin, no one spoke as the firewater burned down our throats. The tour guide talked about the abandoned distillery we were walking through, telling us about how the first gang had all but disappeared before the legendary Al Capone got his hands on the operation. She must have told the story often as she spoke fluidly and made gestures and pauses at all the right moments.  \n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm not one for tall tales but what we know of the disappearance of the Maddy Hatter Gang is very much a vampire story if ever I heard one.  The Maddy Hatter Gang was mostly made up of the Maddock family led by the father Hank who had a thing about collecting hats from the rival gang members he butchered. He must have stolen the wrong hat because that bloodlust came back to haunt him in the fall of 1921 when his gang disappeared with only the youngest of the family left to tell the tale of what had befallen them. And what had befallen them was indeed a great mystery. A mystery people to this day bicker about and dismiss as an urban legend. But I swear it's no legend and all of it is the truth.  \n\n\"The twins Candice and Coddy, while returning with some equipment they had picked up in Ontario, drove into the valley and then carried the copper tubing and flasks into the caves where the gang prepared their white lightning. But when they arrived they found nothing but blood. Blood on the floor. Blood on the walls. Blood, if you'll believe it, running through the tubes and coils of the still. At first, they thought it may have been a rival gang. But there was no sign of bullets or bodies or even a struggle—just blood and an uncanny fog that hung low and heavy in the air.   \n\n\"The twins instantly resolved to find whoever had done this to their gang and moreover they wanted to give their siblings, cousins and parents a proper burial. So they grabbed a lantern and plunged into the twisting bowels of the mountain, following a trail of blood. They searched deep into the night with no result. Coddy shone the lantern and was just about to tell his sister he was beaten when he heard the crunch of stone in the distance.  He charged ahead, and she chased after him, stumbling over a boulder, hitting her head against the ground and losing consciousness.  \n\n\"When Candice roused, she sprang to her feet and rushed toward the flickering lantern light, screaming her brother's name. Through dancing shadow and light, she approached her pale brother sprawled over the ground with two small puncture wounds in his neck. She felt his chest for a pulse and gasped when she realized he was dead. She shuddered, then screamed, and moved by an unknown force, she grabbed the lantern and charged forward. Then, without realizing it, she entered a massive cavern, feeling the ground beneath her feet turn to mush.   \n\n\"She shone her lantern around, revealing piles of human skulls amidst thousands of beetles moving through a thick sludge. At her feet, she saw a few beetles devouring a sick bat. She tensed and looked upward to see thousands of bats sleeping. A few beetles scurried over her foot with morsels of rotting flesh and she kicked them away. She swallowed her fear, realizing that if she woke the bats, they would strip her flesh clean in a matter of minutes.  Then she glanced at familiar barrels in the corner by a pile of animal bones. \n\n\"Silently and carefully, she made her way past the bones.  Opening the barrel, she cringed as a horrible stench assaulted her nose. She peered at the dark brew and wasn't sure what she was looking at. Then she realized she was staring at fermenting lumps of flesh in thick, putrid blood. She was in the vampire's lair.  But before she could continue her search, a roar suddenly startled her.  \n\n\"Candice turned and found herself staring at a demon with fangs with a swirling black fog rising at its feet. Through the fog, she saw it was wearing her father's hat. She gave a shout of revenge like thunder. The vampire twisted its ugly head in startled disbelief. Fearlessly, Candice threw herself at the vampire. She didn't care what this thing was or where it came from. She just wanted it dead, and she wanted to do her family proud. The vampire meant to kill her by sinking its fangs in her neck. But she felt strong enough to bring down a mountain.  \n\n\"And so she jerked and kicked and pushed its snarling face. With a snarl of her own, she bit back at the vampire, tearing pale flesh off its neck with teeth and jaws strong enough to crush rock.  Before the vampire realized what was happening, she gouged its eye with her thumb, ramming it deeper and deeper as it desperately clawed flesh off her arms and face. But she didn't care. She would not be denied, and within moments she felt the delicate brain matter like warm mud and smiled. Then she curled her finger and yanked as hard as she could with a mad laugh.  \n\n\"With a shriek, the vampire convulsed violently, then stopped all at once, its jaws frozen in a twisted, agonized howl. Unable to control her growing laughter, she took back her father's hat and stood proudly as open wounds leaked and sputtered blood. Then the fog rolled over the vampire and somehow made it all disappear. The vampire. The bats. The beetles. The blood. Everything.  \n\n\"Needless to say, no one believed Candice and she was put into an asylum to shut-up and wither away. But eventually, some rich philanthropist took charge of her, and she was never seen again.\"  \n\nEveryone was silent. Someone laughed and said, \"That's not really a vampire story, is it?\"  \n\nThe tour guide replied, \"Not like we're used to, no. But that's her story and I swear I told it like I heard it.\" \n\nThen a young woman, in a concerned voice, added, \"I hope that girl ended up all right.\" "}]}]},"Tome08":{"Vignettes":[{"VignetteId":"Tome08_Jake","Name":"Exile of the Kingdom","SubTitle":"Memories: Jake Park","Entries":[{"Title":"Memory 881 ","Text":"Jake bites his lower lip with the thought of chowing down on a rack of ribs—smoking, charred, succulent ribs.

It was a longing… a profound longing to know where he came from and why his father never talked about him.  \n\nBut you didn’t have to push him so hard, did you?  \n\nI did. I had to. I had to because I had the right to know who he was. Don’t you see? I have an emptiness inside me that no money or thing can fill. Yet… he never told me anything about him… he just distracted himself with the business and all the trappings of a superficial life and—  \n\nRaising you, Jake! Raising his boys!  \n\nJake stares past trampled grass and he hears his mother’s voice resounding through his head. Jake… please… you are expecting a straight thing, and no straight thing has ever been made. Your father isn’t perfect, and everything he’s done is to give you a better life than he had. He has his reasons.  \n\nAnd I have mine!  \n\nJake closes his eyes. He remembers leaving home without saying goodbye. He remembers backpacking across Korea, meeting people who had known his grandfather and could tell him stories about how he had lived. And none of the stories he had been told justified burying the past the way his father had done. He had expected his grandfather to be an abusive, deadbeat and yet… he had discovered a hero… a legend even. He had saved and reunited so many families and so many were grateful and indebted and still… he never mentioned him.  \n\nMaybe he didn’t want a legend, Jake. Maybe he wanted something else. But why does it matter? Why does it matter right now?  \n\nA voice of caution suddenly brings Jake back to the moment. His grandfather’s voice or what he thinks his grandfather would have sounded like. Jake… stop thinking about everything else except what you need to think about. You need to eat before you begin to see things that aren’t there. You’ve been at it all morning and afternoon with that make-shift spear, and if you don’t get the hog you’ll end up like me.  \n\nJake nods with a slight respectful bow as he examines the freshly trampled grass."},{"Title":"Memory 882","Text":"Jake charges after the boar as it zigzags through the long grass and suddenly disappears near the creek. Panting, he slows to a jog, searching left and right. He’s hiding. Hiding like the letter his father hid in the attic. Don’t lose your focus, Jake… not now… not again…  \n\nI don’t understand why he would hide such a beautiful letter in a shoebox?  \n\nAh, yes…the letter. It’s the letter that set you off on your journey. It’s the letter that inspired you to learn your father’s language properly. You wanted to translate it for yourself, and you did. But now, Jake, you need to stop thinking about the letter, about your father, about the past… you need to focus on the hunt or none of it will matter anymore. Find food or become food.  \n\nJake winces. His grandfather would never say such a thing. That’s something his father would say. The voices in his head are mixing like a horrible stew of fermenting leftovers. He doesn’t remember when he started hearing the voices but at some point out on his own in the mountains, he realized he was talking to himself and that talking to himself helped him cope with the loneliness.  \n\nEveryone hears voices inside their head, Jake, although most are too distracted to listen or even acknowledge them, or, if they do acknowledge them, they keep them private for fear of ridicule.  \n\nMost of Jake’s voices are family members and old friends that make friendly talk here and there, but as of late the voices poke and question everything he does.  \n\nAnd now for the last two days he was hearing a new voice. A mocking voice that highlighted and criticized every mistake he made like his dreaded high school English teacher that made him read garbage he didn’t connect with or gave him nicknames like ‘muddle brain’ for mixings up words, reading backwards and seeing things in the stories she claimed weren’t there. They were. She just lacked imagination and perspective.  \n\nIt was her voice—teeth grinding on wool—that squelched through his mind to undermine his dignity and confidence as a thinking human being.   \n\nJake was convinced his teacher had existed solely to prevent those with other ideas and perspectives from ever pursing a literary career. His father didn’t care about his issue with his English teacher or with teachers in general.  \n\nIt didn’t matter.  \n\nStories didn’t matter.  \n\nJust tell the teacher what she wants to hear. Think of her as your boss and think of grades as money. Parrot her ideas and opinions and you’ll be rewarded with lots of money… maybe even a bonus or a promotion.   \n\nEasy enough advice to follow.  \n\nAnd yet his father’s advice did nothing to improve his sense of otherness in relation to the stories and curriculum he was subjected to on an almost daily basis. He still felt like an outsider for lacking interest in the literature and history he was expected to read and memorize as truths undeniable. Seemed like there was a big chunk of perspective missing from the overall narrative being poured into him like concrete that made him feel like he didn’t belong.  \n\nBut what does it matter now?  \n\nIt doesn’t.  \n\nLeave the past in the past and focus on what needs to get done.  \n\nI’m trying.  \n\nListen here, big brother… the sun’s coming down, you’re having conversations with yourself, and your cells are about to cannibalize one another. Find your focus."},{"Title":"Memory 883","Text":"Jake sits on a stone and watches a hawk circle against the golden dusk. He sighs and feels his stomach twist. He needs something… anything… and he regrets not taking the free granola bars from the clerk at the hunting store.

What’s so special this time?  \n\nJake draws a deep, anxious breath. I don’t know…  \n\nThe hawk sails through the darkening sky, then swoops and quickly disappears near the stream. Jake stares after it for a long moment, then decides. He grabs his spear, staggers to his feet and stealthily makes his way toward the shimmering water.  \n\nBy a fallen tree he sees the hawk picking at feathers and bones. He inches closer, lifts his spear and launches it. The spear hits the ground, and the hawk rockets to the sky, leaving scraps behind. Scraps… Scraps will do. For now.  \n\nJake kneels by a sticky clump of flesh and feathers. He smells the pungent odor of heart-pounding red. He touches the sticky innards and the plucked skin and the bones… bones as white as the hog’s grin.  \n\nJake sighs his frustration and shakes his head. He doesn’t know if hogs display any kind of emotion. But if they can… this hog is definitely smiling. No… Not smiling… Laughing. \n\nWhat kind of bird is this, anyway?  \n\nDoesn’t matter. Jake pulls out matches and cooks the guts, preparing a kind of bird-pudding.  \n\nYou brought matches but no granola bars?  \n\nI don’t know what I was thinking.  \n\nYou’re not him, Jake.  \n\nI know.  \n\nHe died out there. \n\nHe disappeared.  \n\nSame thing.  \n\nNot to me.

How’d he lead them out of the woods with soldiers tracking them?  \n\nJake stops suddenly to examine a few broken twigs. He brings his focus back to the hunt, trying to determine which direction the hog took. Then he hears it.  \n\nSnorting.  \n\nAlmost inaudible, but he hears it. He turns toward a patch of shuffling high grass and narrows his gaze. The snorting grows louder and louder. He’s laughing at me!

A high pitch squeal follows, and the hog jolts away!  \n\nJake surges after him, tracking a trail of red to the mouth of a small cave. He laughs to himself and knows he will feast tonight.

He takes in the scent of thick, fatty, white bacon melting into mounds of burning black charcoal. He reaches around his father and pulls off a strip and devours it. His father smiles and says it’s like he’s never seen food before.  \n\nJake’s eyes widen as thick, droplets of grease drip off his chin. He suddenly pushes past his father and brother, attacking the grill, stuffing his face with greasy, life-giving fat and protein. His father tries to hold him back but Jake won’t be denied when suddenly the meat morphs into a living, wild hog. The hog turns to Jake and winks.  \n\nJake stumbles back and falls into the pool.  \n\nThe pool swirls and turns into a deadfall as several spikes rip through his chest. Jake yells in agony, waking up with a start, finding himself in a small pit beside thick, sharpened branches pointed outward.  \n\nJake wipes the sweat off his brow and slowly clambers to his feet.

What’s the use? It’s just gonna end up in a shoebox in the attic like his father’s letter.  \n\nYou’re wrong.

He helped so many people survive exposure, exhaustion and starvation. He saved them all and yet… he couldn’t save himself.  \n\nThey said there was a kind of smoke, too… a thick black smoke that suddenly surrounded them. One minute he was there. The next… he was gone. The survivors Jake had spoken to in Seoul said he was probably captured and executed but that they didn’t know for sure.  \n\nA piercing squeal followed by a meaty thunk suddenly brings Jake back to the moment. He didn’t even see the hog make a dash for it.

Sorry, brother… it was either you or me.  "},{"Title":"Memory 888","Text":"Jake swallows a piece of charred meat and stares beyond the flickering fire at the gutted hog. All he need to do now is salt the meat. Took the whole day to get him but it was worth it. There’s enough meat on him to last him months. The bloody and carved hog suddenly turns to Jake. But you didn’t really get me, did you? Jake blinks. And blinks, again. Truth is I let you catch me cause I figured you chased me long enough. Jake shakes his head in disbelief, and he knows his mind is still playing tricks on him despite having eaten. The hog sighs sadly. You and I, Jake, we’re caught in the same vicious cycle so don’t feel so bad, all right? Today it’s me. Tomorrow it’s you.  \n\nJake pinches himself but the hog continues. Chase something long enough and it will surrender itself to you. It will stop running and let you catch it so long as you stay the course. Just like that story you chased in the old country. Jake narrows his gaze on the grinning hog. Now you’re here on Blood Mountain trying to be your grandfather while trying to forget your father without realizing you’re both and neither of them at the same time.  \n\nJake tries to shake the hallucination out of his head. Don’t worry, Jake, I’m not really talking… you’re tired and dehydrated… and completely lost in the woods. I’m just trying to give you some perspective or rather… you’re trying to give yourself some perspective.  \n\nJake sighs deeply. I have no idea who I am or what I want to do and I’m talking to a dead hog in the middle of nowhere. The hog nods. Yes, you are. It’s interesting because your grandfather was poor and didn’t have many options and you’re not so poor and have too many options… I’m not sure which is worse… the tyranny of too little or the tyranny of too much… either way… a distracted life is a wasted life…  \n\nIt’s good that you came out here to figure things out. And you know what else is good? If you let go… if you just let go…  \n\nI have let go and I’m still as lost as I ever was.  \n\nThe hog snorts. You haven’t let go, Jake. You’re still playing the old scripts over and over again like a broken record. But let’s see… you like chasing stories… especially the hidden ones… you talk to yourself constantly… and you like being alone… maybe you’re a writer, Jake. Or maybe you’re a historian. \n\nJake laughs out loud. Are you kidding me! I hate history, and I failed every English class in high school cause I thought the rules were stupid and the teachers were boring.  \n\nYou and every other writer that actually made a dent. English class doesn’t make a writer, Jake… Fighting class and dancing class do.   \n\nI don’t even know what that means!  \n\nIt means you need guts and style, not grades and diplomas. It means you need courage and not the validation of some coward that doesn’t know what it’s like to lead someone on a dancefloor or step into a ring. It means your country needs a lot more stories like yours. Because let’s face it, Jake, if your story isn’t in the main narrative… if you’re just a footnote in a history book… you may as well not exist.  \n\nYou’re not your grandfather, Jake. You’re not your father either. And every generation has its challenge. Oppression. War. Separation. Maybe the challenge of your generation is… representation. You gotta get your stories out there whether you’re a writer, historian, filmmaker or producer. Seems to me a lot of kids like you in the new country need to hear your story or stories like yours to know they aren’t alone. To know they belong and that they aren’t outsiders in their own home.  \n\nA chorus of howls brings Jake back to the moment. Wolves! And they’re coming for what’s mine! They howl again, and above the racquet he hears his father’s voice. In every transaction, Jake, there are wolves.  \n\nNot in this one.  \n\nEspecially this one.  \n\nJake ignores the voice in his head and tries to focus as he considers his next move carefully.

Give him nowhere to run but the Haunted Hostel and really have some fun with the chump. Moustache sprints towards the rundown shack, covered in spatters of red paint and cheap imitation spider webs. But then—he turns. Beelines away from the Haunted Hostel and towards… no, not that—the Fun House of Friendship. All the makeup in the world can't cover the disgust. A deep, resigned sigh.

Other Terra Worlds have quite unique and sometimes contradictory versions of the Harbinger series which make them difficult to track and interpret. But despite the discrepancies, each version seems to feature siblings trying to expose a nefarious cult devoted to The Entity.  \n\nI am currently searching the rift for the real memories that inspired all these adventures to see how close they are to the actual inspiration. I’m even wondering if Haddie and Jordan are here, trapped in The Entity, and, if they are, I’m hoping their memories will somehow help me find a way out of here. So far, I have found nothing close to a real memory, but I did find another story from Terra 717 in which Haddie discusses a phenomenon she calls ‘The Overlap’ and which other stories call The Borro, The Coil, The Bleed, etc.  \n\nI’m currently keeping extensive notes on the Harbinger stories and their descriptions of The Overlap to see if any of them can give me insight into what this phenomenon actually is. What I’ve discovered so far is that almost all of these stories describe places where a dark dimension intersects with the world and that these intersections seem to attract tragedy and misfortune. Some of these stories go so far as to claim ‘broken’ or ‘traumatized’ people can derive strange abilities from the vibrations emanating from these dark and ‘cursed’ places. These people can ultimately use The Bleed—my preferred name for the phenomenon—to access knowledge beyond the veil as it were.  \n\nThe Harbinger series from Terra 719 is also worth noting because the details included by the author seem closest to what we studied back home concerning Ancients and living dimensions, not to mention what I’ve been able to discover by examining the memories of souls marooned here. Piece by piece, or rather, story by story, I’m getting closer to salvation… or insanity… whichever comes first.  "},{"Title":"Chamber of Blood. HarbingerFM.  Worlds Away. 1. ","Text":"Haddie entered the small deli in Manhattan, New York, approached a small booth, and plopped an envelope in front of her stepbrother Jordan. He stopped chewing his early morning, scrambled eggs and asked, “What’s this supposed to be?”  \n\n“I know who our mysterious benefactor is!” Haddie opened the envelope and pulled out a picture of a middle-aged man with salt and pepper hair in a dark suit.  \n\nJordan shrugged. “Who am I looking at?” \n\n“Surin Rivera. He was a sound engineer for a highly classified military project in the Office of Strategic Operations. He experienced a nervous breakdown and was institutionalized for years until he was released under the care of billionaire, philanthropist Kobe Dax. Others in the same program experienced similar breakdowns. One lives close by. The question is… why is Surin helping us?”  \n\nJordan raised his finger and pointed to a man standing behind Haddie. “Why don’t you ask him yourself?” Haddie turned to face the man in the picture standing beside her.  \n\nSurin took a seat beside Jordan and said, “You need to leave my case alone. I assure you both… You’re not ready for what you’re prying into.”  \n\n“And what is that?” Haddie questioned.  \n\nJordan took a small, nervous bite of his eggs and chewed slowly. “Let’s not provoke the man, sis. If we’re not ready… we’re not ready… I’m good with that.”  \n\n“How do you know our uncle?” Haddie asked when he didn’t answer her question. “Why are you helping us? What are these places you’re sending us to?”  \n\nSurin peered at Haddie for a long moment. Then he said, “Let’s just say I have a fond interest in your work and your special abilities.”  \n\nJordan swallowed and shrugged. “Okay… sure… that’s good enough for me.”  \n\n“Not me.” Haddie’s face hardened as she waited for an answer. “I want to know why your helping us.”  \n\nSurin scanned the deli nervously, then turned back to Haddie and Jordan. “Take my advice and don’t go down this rabbit hole. Not yet. You’re not ready, and you’re exposing yourself to dangerous people.”  \n\n“What kind of people?” Haddie narrowed her gaze on him. “Police? Military? What are we talking about here?”  \n\nSurin shook his head gravely. “We’re talking about people who don’t answer to the police or military. People who create governments and corporations to use to their end and then throw them away like garbage when they’re done.”  \n\n“What do they want?” Haddie asked, unsatisfied with his answer.  \n\nSurin stood. “Leave my case alone. Focus on the show and the leads I send your way. All will be revealed in due time.” \n\nHaddie held up the envelope with his picture. “I’m getting ahead of myself… is that it?” \n\n“Leave my case alone,” Surin repeated and walked away.  \n\nHaddie and Jordan watched Surin exit the deli in silence. Then Jordan turned to see Haddie’s determined expression, and he knew they weren’t leaving anything alone.  "},{"Title":"Chamber of Blood. HarbingerFM.  Worlds Away. 2. ","Text":"“Come on, bro! Let’s get ahead of ourselves!” Haddie led Jordan to the entrance of a dilapidated house in the suburbs. “Colonel Jim Dunn worked with Surin Rivera in the OSO.” Before Haddie could say another word the door creaked open, revealing a plump, middle-age woman with short blond hair.  \n\n“Can I help you?” \n\nHaddie smiled. “Yes. I was actually hoping to speak to Col Lt Dunn for our podcast.”  \n\nThe woman took a step back. “Is this some kind of a prank?”  \n\nHaddie shook her head. “No, ma’am.” \n\n“Jim disappeared seven years ago. No one has any answers for me, and all I’m left with are rumors.” \n\nJordan inched closer to the woman. “Maybe our podcast could help? Maybe someone out there can help you if you share his story.”  \n\n“Share his story?” The woman hesitated for a moment. Then she nodded and said, “Yeah… all right… I just want my Jim back.”  \n\nHaddie and Jordan entered the home and followed her to the kitchen where they sat around a small, round table.  \n\n“I can only tell you what Jim told me,” the woman said, taking a deep breath and releasing it slowly to calm her nerves. “He worked for the Office of Strategic Operations which was… I guess you could say… the stuff of conspiracy theories.”  \n\nShe paused, then continued. “Did you know Jim said the word ‘conspiracy theory’ used to never exist until the military created the term? Once you could actually question the government’s narrative but now… you’re not questioning anything because you don’t want to be called a ‘conspiracy theorist.’” \n\nThe woman laughed, then added, “Brilliant, really, and that’s pretty much why no one questions the government anymore… even if you’ve got a dozen whistleblowers with leaked documents all saying the same thing… you don’t really doubt or question anything cause you don’t want to be stigmatized.” \n\nThe woman shook her head in disbelief and continued with a little laugh. “Jim used to say the origin of ‘conspiracy theory’ is a conspiracy theory… anyway… he told me… there were places in the world that weren’t like other places… places which defied the laws of physics… which defied human comprehension… places connected to worlds away… to other dimensions… the government called it The Overlap. Crazy stuff, right? ” \n\nJordan nodded.  \n\nHaddie didn’t respond. She had heard the term before when they were investigating a mysterious cult that believed in a kind of ancient deity that would one day help humanity evolve to another plane of existence. It’s a strange coincidence that this cult and the government would have the same name for the phenomenon.  \n\n“Like a wormhole?” Jordan questioned.  \n\nThe woman shook her head. “That’s not how Jim described it. He didn’t talk much about The Overlap but he said what they had seen made him think another world was… how did he put it… consuming ours… like these Overlaps were growing bigger and bigger as we went down a kind of celestial digestive track… and… he said… he said they were pulling stuff out… things from other worlds….”  \n\nThe woman fell silent and thoughtful for a long moment. “I could see changes in him. He was getting angrier and mean and he was never mean. He stopped sharing things with me. And I started hearing rumors.” \n\n“What kind of rumors?” Haddie asked, leaning forward.  \n\nThe woman went silent and thoughtful. Then she said, “Rumors that the government was doing things to them so they could stay in The Overlap for longer periods of time. I even heard that they pulled someone out from another world. Imagine that… a person from another world or dimension.” \n\nTears filled her eyes. “They say he left me… but I know my Jim… something happened to him and the authorities dismiss me as conspiracy theorist for saying otherwise. But I’ll tell you this—” \n\nA sudden report and the woman’s mouth filled with thick, warm blood as she tried to speak. Shattered teeth and saliva gushed out instead of words. Then her eye went wide and she slumped forward.  \n\nJordan cursed and instantly tackled Haddie to the ground as bullets began to rip through the house from every direction.  \n\nHaddie stared up at her brother as bullets flew over their heads like angry wasps. “I think… we got ahead of ourselves.” \n\n“You think!”  "},{"Title":"Chamber of Blood. HarbingerFM.  Worlds Away. 3.  ","Text":"Bullets discharged from a flashing muzzle in the living room as Haddie followed her brother into the basement of the house. They stumbled down the stairs into the darkness and through a beam of sunlight pouring through a rectangular window. Before they could hide, the assassin was already descending the stairs with his rifle trained on them. Haddie and Jordan held hands and closed their eyes waiting for a quick death. A loud report sounded and when they opened their eyes they were both still standing.  \n\nThe assassin stared at them with big white eyes of disbelief, then he collapsed to reveal Surin holding a smoking revolver. “Come on,” he said. “We need to leave before others come.”  \n\nThe siblings didn’t hesitate, following Surin up the stairs and out the door past several dead bodies. Haddie counted seven dead assassins by the time she followed her brother into an unmarked black sedan. With a great sense of urgency, Surin started the engine, hit the accelerator and the car peeled away. After a silence, Haddie asked, “Is any of it true? The rumors? Worlds intersecting? The Overlap?”  \n\nSurin didn’t take his eyes off the road as he drove them back to the hotel where their uncle was waiting for them. “I can’t really answer that right now and you need to focus on your next episode. You’re here to investigate the old, abandoned subway station, and I think you should stick to the agenda.”  \n\n“Is it an Overlap?” Jordan asked. “Is that why there were so many accidents? Is that why it was abandoned?”   \n\nSurin hesitated, then nodded gravely.  \n\n“What do you and a billionaire care about the old, subway?” Haddie asked.  \n\nSurin sighed, took a moment to find his words, then answered. “I’m looking for my colleagues. We explored these areas all over the world and a few of us never returned and those that did… they came back to us… lost… confused… insane, even. I want answers. I want to know what happened to the others. I know they’re still alive. They’re lost somewhere… between worlds.”  \n\n“So you’re using us to find them?” Haddie said flatly.  \n\n“We’re helping each other in mutually beneficial ways.”  \n\nHaddie shook her head. “I need to know more. That’s not enough for me.”  \n\nSurin sighed and pulled the sedan over to the shoulder of the road and killed the engine. After a long thoughtful moment, he looked at the siblings in the rear-view mirror and said, “I was undergoing some, let’s say, unorthodox training to enter The Overlap… but it wasn’t possible… it’s like an impossible energy that pulls… I don’t know… hell… pulls hell right out of you… I mean there’s no other way to describe it. What you feel is just pure darkness. But the OSO figured when the mind is developing it can be… it can be fractured… broken in ways so that it rewires itself to withstand the stress of The Overlap.” \n\n“You turned children into tools!” Jordan spat in disgust. \n\nSurin looked away from the rear-view mirror and lowered his gaze without answering.  \n\n“And so I’m your new tool,” Haddie said. There was a short silence as Haddie considered her last few investigations. She remembered finding journals in the old asylum that had notes about other realms. Memories of other people trapped in a deathless world and journal entries revealing thoughts about how artists and writers were able to somehow tune into these other worlds with what they believed was their imagination but what was actually their third eye. It was a strange theory that Haddie had dismissed as the ravings of a depraved lunatic with a wild imagination. But something the patient had written had stuck with her.  \n\nThe truth is in the story.   \n\nHaddie whispered the words to herself and thought she would give those notebooks another read in case she had missed something. She had them stored in her studio apartment in Montreal and would force Stefan to make a detour before their next investigation.  \n\n“You don’t understand,” Surin continued. “This isn’t just about the friends I lost… There are things in The Overlap we need to understand. There could be a new type of energy… a new way of seeing the world… the universe—”  \n\nJordan interrupted with a laugh. “Or… there’s nothing there… and it’s just a living hell.”  "},{"Title":"Chamber of Blood.

Online rumors suggest a biological terrorist attack unlike anything we’ve seen but no organization has stepped forward to claim responsibility and nothing has been confirmed officially. What we do know is generators at the power company exploded into violent flames taking down powerlines leaving the western sector of the city in the dark. City Police report these unknown creatures attacked several automobiles near the company and are considered extremely dangerous. At least three motorists are dead and four others are in critical condition. Motorists are urged to avoid roads near the power station and the 93 South. That’s the latest we have on the attacks.

The spokesperson for the Falls City General Hospital reports an unusual and alarming increase of poison cases due to an unknown spider the size of a fist with bright orange spiral-like markings on its back. The authorities are calling it the hell-back spider and advise you to stay at least two meters away from the spider should you come in contact with one. Federal officials say they are trying to cope with this situation and are still trying to determine if this is in fact a terrorist attack or another phenomenon known as ‘Spontaneous Evolution’ in which new species suddenly appear without any plausible scientific explanation. Other theories suggest a government experiment gone wrong as in the case of the weaponized ticks carrying the human-made Lyme disease variant that escaped from a classified biological warfare laboratory on Apricot Island. The situation seems to be reaching emergency proportions as more and more districts lose power. The city’s coroner’s office says dozens of corpses now reveal the poison from the hell-back spider to be slow and lethal as boils and puss slowly cover the body. There also seem to be indications that some victims go on murderous rampages induced by fever, overactive adrenal glands and what can only be described as a complete loss of sanity. Infected individuals are to be handled with extreme caution until the boils cover the entire body and movement becomes practically impossible. A representative of the Falls City Power Company says they are actively trying to fix the generators to restore electricity but a strange black fog is slowing down repair crews. Anonymous workers at the company are saying on social media that they are hearing strange sounds coming from the fog and believe it may somehow be linked to the spiders. One report claims a worker’s body burst open with spiders after she inhaled the fog. Another report says that before the initial attacks, carcasses of deer were found with thousands if not millions of spiders crawling out of them. I should repeat that… There is a fog and it seems to be carrying microscopic eggs that require a biological host… We advise people to stay calm and take extreme caution if they come in contact with the fog or a hell-back spider.

His childhood fear vanished as he learned to divulge himself through the intricacy and pliability of pop, his inner thoughts riding atop soundwaves, fusing together with other genres—rock, hip hop, jazz, punk. It was the music that could deliver him the explosive fame he deserved, a promise that he would never be upstaged.

An anonymous post claims that the victim was last seen alive at the Trickster's VIP meet-up after his concert in New York early this year. Yun-Jin remembers that night. Not because of the concert, but because of a detail that has been replaying in her mind ever since. Bleeding scratch marks on the Trickster's forearms when he showed up at the concert’s afterparty. The rumors online were rekindling the suspicion she silenced before. <br><br>Years ago, the Trickster and she arrived in Miami several days earlier than planned. Yun-Jin attended networking events while the Trickster rehearsed. Three days following their arrival, a folksinger was found dead downtown, near the bar where he performed. A security footage was released to the public showing a man dressed in black with his face covered, leading the singer down an alley. The dark, blurry footage revealed little about the suspect. But Yun-Jin noticed a detail that twisted her stomach in knots. She recognized the gold rimmed headphones around the suspect’s neck with two large “Xs”, one for each ear. It was the brand-new model of the Xerxes 1050x headphones, which few audiophiles knew about and even fewer could afford. She recognized the model right away because the Trickster favored their equipment over other expensive models. He wore a similar pair on the plane to Miami, but then switched to a lesser model for the rest of the tour, which only fueled her doubts. <br><br>Back then, however, she was not in a good place. The death of NO SPIN was still fresh. Acute insomnia kept her mind in a haze and the jet lag of the tour only worsened her state. In the end, she decided to let the police do their job and focus on hers; producing music. But now someone else was dead, someone whom the Trickster might have been the last one to see alive. The headphones, the scratch marks, and the late-night outs were details, but they added up. <br><br>How many coincidences does it take to know? <br><br>A knock on the door makes her jump. The head of security is here. Yun-Jin follows her gut. She confronts him. She bluffs about firing the whole security crew if he does not come clean. It pays off. She learns that the Trickster left the hotel premises last night. His bodyguard tried to follow but lost him on the way. <br><br>Yun-Jin pounds her fist on the table. <br><br> Why would he leave the hotel? To go where? And… to do what? <br><br>Despite working with the Trickster for years, he is still no more than a stranger. While he generates incredible profit, it comes at a cost. If the Trickster is linked to a murder, so is she. Even if there is no evidence. Even if it’s just rumors. It’s her life on the line. Her entire career. She could never produce music again. And the worst part is… it's her own fault. She knows better than to trust someone in this industry.  <br><br>She needs to get answers, before it is too late.

To get away from the dogs he would hide in the crawl space underneath his cabin, or he would hide in the shed where he kept his snowmobile, or sometimes he would escape to the glaciers and hide in the ice caves where he prayed for the howling and the yelping and the whimpering to stop. But the howling and the yelping and the whimpering never stopped, and no matter where he hid, the dogs always found him.  \n\nThe first day Duncan saw the dogs was the day he started questioning his job. Or rather, it was the day he started questioning the law and what he was doing with the law. There was something about legally destroying dogs that felt off… that felt… wrong… something that tugged at his heart and wouldn’t let go… something telling him that he needed to get out of the cold, lonely Arctic Archipelago before it was too late—if it wasn’t already too late.  \n\nFor Duncan, it was the first time in his career as a police officer that he realized that the law wasn’t always the glorified tool for civilization he had imagined it to be. Sometimes the law was something else.  Something blunt. Something hard.  Something almost like a gavel… a gavel of destruction or oppression or perhaps both—destruction and oppression.  \n\nTruth is, Duncan wasn’t sure what he was thinking anymore. He was exhausted, and the dogs… well… the dogs just wouldn’t leave him be, and all he wanted to do was return home and farm. He liked working on the farm. Things were simpler on the farm. But here, up north, things were more complicated, and Duncan couldn’t help but think about the law.  \n\nAbout the gavel.  \n\nAnd the last thing Duncan wanted to do was wield that gavel against anyone. And yet—to his everlasting regret—he had used it against the dogs.  \n\nAnd though he had done everything by the book… and though the law said he had committed no crime… his heart continually testified to the opposite.   \n\nTo be sure, Duncan had led countless dogs to the bay, where he had shot them like vermin in front of their owners. And it was only when he was alone and surrounded by their ghosts that he would admit to himself that what he had done didn’t feel so right and that maybe… just maybe… these dogs weren’t the dangerous beasts or the diseased rats his captain had made them out to be. They were… well… they were something else.   \n\nThey were friends.  \n\nThey were family members.  \n\nThey played with children, entertained them and kept them safe. They warned against approaching wolves and polar bears, and even snowstorms. And more than anything they made sure no hunter ever got lost in a blizzard unlike those unreliable ‘iron dogs’ or snowmobiles that broke down in the middle of nowhere and left a trail of black smoke across the cold, white, endless expanse. No ‘iron dog’ ever led someone out of a blizzard. The same… well… the same could not be said of the dogs…  \n\n…the dogs he had so heartlessly destroyed.  \n\nBut in those days—when the production of the first commercial ‘iron dog’ commenced—there weren’t many challenges to the law, and so Duncan certainly tried to convince himself that he was doing the good and lawful thing for everyone.  \n\nAnd while it’s true that the mind might not make the difference between what is right and what is lawful, the heart certainly does.   \n\nThe heart—it is often said—doesn’t lie.  \n\nNonetheless, Duncan found ways to trick himself and ignore the appeals of his heart. He told himself these dogs weren’t like other dogs, and he actually believed his lie for a few months. But as time wore on, he very quickly realized that these dogs were… well… like the dogs he had known back home.  \n\nKnowing this made it harder and harder for him to fall asleep, and soon he started to hallucinate and see all the dogs he had shot.  \n\nAt first it was just one. Then it was two. Then a dozen. Then a dozen became a hundred. And a hundred became a thousand. A thousand dead dogs howled and stared at Duncan every night, preventing him from sleeping, from dreaming, from thinking—preventing him from living the life he had once known.    \n\nEverywhere Duncan went, there they were, the dogs, looking at him with those eyes—those pleading, confused eyes, wondering what they had done wrong, or how they had failed their family and friends to deserve such a cold and indifferent end.  \n\nTruth is, Duncan couldn’t escape those ghosts any more than a dog could escape its own tail. Wherever he went, there they were, following him, reminding him of all the lives he had disrupted and destroyed with… well… with that gavel.  \n\nOne evening, Duncan sat in bed, holding his aching head in his hands, staring at the decaying dogs sitting all around him. They watched him closely as he tried to fall asleep and howled or barked every time his eyelids began to slip. Trembling with fear and exhaustion, Duncan murmured he had done nothing wrong and that he had acted in accordance with the law and that they should just leave him alone. But— \n\nThe dogs wouldn’t leave him alone. They just stared at him in silence with those eyes—eyes that reminded him of his own dog.   \n\nAnguished, Duncan lurched from his bed, screaming at the dogs, telling them he needed to sleep and that he wasn’t going to feel guilty for doing his damn job! He outright refused to apologize or feel guilty for doing what the law required him to do. What the law said he had to do!  \n\nThe dogs suddenly stirred anxiously about the cabin with their heads down and tails between their legs. Duncan’s screams grew louder and louder, and one by one, the dogs whimpered and whined for their lives like they had done when they had been destroyed. Then—just like that—they vanished into thin air as though Duncan had finally scared them away.   \n\nWhen Duncan realized the dogs were gone, he collapsed into his bed and prayed that they should finally leave him alone. He just wanted his life back, for the dogs had robbed him of his strength and freedom and even his sense of identity as a morally upright officer of the law.   \n\nThat night, a storm picked up and blew all around his small cabin. Feeling a chill seep through his bones, Duncan rose from the bed, and he made a small fire in the iron stove as he remembered his first and only dog, Buster, a plump Yellow Labrador Retriever with a black snout.  \n\nSmartest, kindest and warmest dog he had ever known.   \n\nTo Duncan, Buster was more than just a dog. He was his guardian, his confidant, his best friend. He was the brother he never had. He caught rodents, guarded against coyotes and drove cattle on the farm. His father used to say a good dog was worth two or three farm-hands, and Buster was certainly worth four. Thinking about it now, he was glad that no one ever used the law against Buster, or any other dog in his town for that matter.  \n\nTo be sure, Buster wasn’t as big or strong as these Arctic dogs, but he was quite the hunter and had once even saved him from a wolverine. But what Duncan remembered most was that Buster used to curl up in bed with him to calm his anxious heart and help him drift away to sleep.   \n\nAnd now Duncan longed for nothing more than the undisturbed, soundless sleep of youth.  And as he longed for sleep, the wind blew harder and fiercer through the cracks of his cabin. The fire flared, flickered and snapped, casting violent shadows that seemed to tell stories.   \n\nDuncan rubbed his eyes to make the hallucinations go away. But wherever he looked the shadows took the form of officers and hunters shooting at confused and frightened dogs as a thick and unnatural black smoke began to fill the cabin.  \n\nDuncan tried to pinch himself awake. But when he realized he wasn’t asleep, he quickly shut his eyes and once again begged for the dogs to just leave him alone.  \n\nHe wanted one night of rest. Just one night! His brain reeled with despair, and he began to hear the warped voice of his captain laughing at him, shouting at him, tormenting him, telling him the dogs were dangerous… aggressive… a definite blight on their future plans.  \n\nDuncan felt madness clutching at the seams of his soul. He screamed that these were lies! All of them!  And when he opened his eyes again, the black smoke was gone, and the shadows were once again meaningless shapes flickering about the cabin.   \n\nBut just as Duncan sighed his relief, he heard a sound.  \n\nA gentle, scratching sound. At the door. Then he heard a bark that sounded vaguely familiar. The bark came again and again and it sounded like— \n\nBuster.  \n\nDuncan narrowed his gaze and cautiously approached the thick, wooden door. The scratching stopped just as he placed his hand on the doorknob. He stood in silence for a long, tense moment. When the scratching came again, he quickly opened the door and caught a fleeting glimpse of yellow fur disappearing beyond thick sheets of falling snow.   \n\nExhausted and confused, Duncan rushed into the churning storm in his undergarments and slippers, yelling for Buster to wait for him. Then he stopped suddenly when he realized he was being irrational. His tired mind was playing tricks on him.  \n\nBuster had been dead for over twenty years. He had been hit by a car. And for a fleeting moment, Duncan remembered holding his paw on the side of the road, calming him down as his life slowly seeped away. He had never cried so much in his life. There was no possible way Buster could still be with him.  \n\nCovered in snow, Duncan told himself the solitude was getting to him and that he just needed one night of undisturbed sleep. He turned back toward the cabin. But as he turned, he realized…  \n\n…he was lost.  \n\nHe couldn’t see an inch in front of him in any direction.  Cold and panic swept over him at once.  He turned and turned as the wind howled and shrieked and whimpered. In the raging blizzard, he could only make out— \n\nDogs.  \n\nGhostly dogs. Dead and decaying dogs. Thousands of them. Running around him. Growling. Howling. Barking. Confusing him.  \n\nDuncan shouted for them to stop, and he tried to scare them off as he had done before. But the dogs grew faster and fiercer as though they were one with the storm.  \n\nDuncan fell to his knees and felt the cold bite all over his trembling body. His face twisted in terror as each dog seemed to pounce out of the storm to take its turn chomping down on him with cold, indifferent teeth. He collapsed to his side in agony. A terrible numbness crept over him, not so much from the cold but the memory of hurting all those poor dogs. He begged for them to stop, and then he did what he had never done before.  \n\nHe confessed his shame and begged for forgiveness.   \n\nAt once, the dogs froze and stared at him with eyes that seemed to look straight into his heart.    \n\nDuncan choked out that he was sorry, that he was truly sorry, and that even though he had done everything by the book, he had done everything wrong. He had done them wrong. He had done their families wrong. And he had done himself wrong.  \n\nAnd as he emptied his heart, he heard a familiar bark as Buster suddenly emerged from the ghostly pack and stood before him.   \n\nThe dogs looked at Buster, then Duncan, then Buster again. A wave of peace seemed to wash over them as they disappeared one by one and left Duncan with his guardian… his friend… his brother. And Buster curled down beside Duncan as his heart slowed to a stop, and the blinding, white storm swept his life away as it had done so many others.  \n\n \n\nWhen Constable Duncan J. Smith didn’t show up at the station the next day, his fellow officers searched for him and found his frozen corpse not ten feet from his cabin. He was lying on his side with a peaceful expression on his face. One officer noticed that he had been running around in circles, while the others questioned why he had been foolish enough to leave his cabin in his undergarments in the middle of a snowstorm.  \n\nThe captain kneeled by Duncan’s frozen black and blue face and sighed.  Just as he ordered someone to cover the body, another officer panicked and rubbed his eyes, claiming he saw dogs all around him.  He stumbled back and screamed for the dogs to stay away from him. No one saw what he was seeing, and the captain told him to stop making jokes at Duncan’s expense. But the frantic officer shrieked in terror and swore that the dogs were real and that they were following him.

And yet other civilizations get a little push… a little nudge… over the cliff. I have studied the final days of countless worlds… been through the memories of so many survivors… and I can say that The Entity doesn’t just corrupt and consume a world… it somehow taps into our collective fears and has a little fun.  From what I’ve observed The Entity seems to take its time cherry-picking souls from a buffet of misery while contemplating a perfect design of destruction as though… as though an apocalypse was a kind of work of art… a kind of masterpiece. This I realize goes against everything I’ve learned about Ancients back home. But I cannot deny that all the stories and memories I’ve been examining suggest a voluntary and not involuntary will to create and destroy on the part of this Ancient. It’s all speculation at this point but the last realm that opened up in the basement allowed me to venture into Terra Arachna where I witnessed the fall of a world to massive, spider-like creatures—monsters that could have only come from The Entity. Not wanting any of those monsters escaping into the tower, I quickly etched a symbol into the basement door to make the realm disappear. Then, just to be certain, I opened the door and all that was left of the apocalypse was a small, empty room covered in dust. But, as I examined the room, I thought I heard a kind of chittering sound in the corridors. I swallowed a growing lump in my throat and cautiously searched the tower to make sure nothing had escaped. I didn’t find anything inside, but noises outside continue to disturb my sleep, and I’m sure I’ve seen things moving in the fog."}]}]},"Tome10":{"Vignettes":[{"VignetteId":"Tome10_01","Name":"Vain Ambition ","SubTitle":"Memories: Amanda Young","Entries":[{"Title":"Memory 9107 ","Text":"Amanda feels her heart racing as the test subject screams on the television screen.

I believe there are several actual Haddies and Jordans stuck here with all the others. The memories I’ve studied so far conflict with one another so that they rarely line up with each other or the fictional stories I found in the Chamber of Blood. However, I must always remember that the collected stories and artwork in the chamber are interpretative, they are not exact, and they were more or less inspired by several versions of the siblings that exist or will exist or have existed within the endless tapestry that is the omniverse.   \n\nThe truth is… The Unknowns have collected so many stories that I don’t know where to begin my research. Currently, I am focusing on The Redcrane and Twelve to Midnight to better understand how the black fog works and how the characters in these stories may have been able to interact with it to their advantage. There are also many versions of Dejavuism that relate a story of how one man found a way into the darkest recesses of this dimension to save the one he loved. But the story doesn’t go into the details of how he managed to find a way in, and I will have to go through other versions of the story to see if there is any information that can help me. Better yet, I am hoping to find his actual memories within the fog to give me a sense of how he found a way into this realm.     "},{"Title":"Chamber of Blood. Day of Night. Mahan Singh. 1.  ","Text":"Mahan Singh spent seventeen years amassing a fortune for his estranged niece by leading mercenary missions all over the world for Leviathon Securities. A decorated soldier in the Indian army, Mahan was discharged after thirteen years of service for disobeying orders while on assignment for the United Nations. Shortly afterward, he joined Leviathon and found himself on a series of strange assignments that involved securing haunted locations and procuring strange artifacts of an occult nature. Locations and artifacts that seemed worthless but were of grave importance to governments and organizations for some reason or another. Mahan didn't know what to make of it. To him, it all felt like a kind of invisible war between secret societies that were somehow able to use governments and corporations like pieces on a chessboard for a bunch of old, moldy books and geometric trinkets from forgotten civilizations.  \n\nNow Mahan was pinned behind a crumbling wall in a village in the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya with his fallen unit scattered in pieces all over the surrounding dirt roads. He had been fighting all day against different units and was fresh out of luck and ammunition.   \n\nThere’s no way out of here, he told himself. I’ve got no support, no ammunition, no luck. Why do you need luck when you have a weapon and your wits? You’ve been in worse situations and survived. Think you are beaten and you are beaten. I am beaten. You are almost beaten, and that’s not the same thing.  \n\nSuddenly, Mahan heard the surrounding mercenaries yelling at one another in Russian. They were planning an attack and coordinating with one another. He peeked around the corner, then ducked fast as several rounds punched holes into the wall sending clouds of dust and stone into the air. He cursed in Punjabi, grabbed his automatic rifle, then craned his head ever so slightly to see fast-moving silhouettes against the full moon closing in on his position. Quickly, he crawled into a nearby home and hid the asset—the ancient scroll—underneath several corpses of British agents he had killed just before the Russians had decided to join their party. Then he hid in the shadows, holding his rifle by the barrel, refusing to die without a fight.  \n\nThey probably all work for The Collector, he told himself. Crazy rich man with too much time and money on his hands. Shah just wants to make sure he gets the scroll before another eccentric billionaire beats him to it. And from where does this prize come? It supposedly comes from a lost, elder civilization with advanced and forbidden knowledge. Nonsense, all of it. A bunch of ancient stories about pagan priests and barbaric rituals and cosmic deities told around a campfire. Ancient sci-fi, at best.  \n\nTaking a deep breath, Mahan heard their almost inaudible footfalls before he saw them. His eyes narrowed and his face hardened as two mercs entered the moonlit doorway. With a groan, he launched himself into the air, smashing the butt of his rifle against one head and then the other.  \n\nBoth mercs collapsed to the ground unconscious. A split-second later, Mahan yanked a loaded rifle from the hands of one of the fallen mercs and rushed through the doorway taking cover behind a well spilling over with thick buzzing flies like living black soup. Inside the well were the rotting bodies of those who had sought the scroll but had found death instead.    \n\nMahan buried his nose in his arm and suppressed an instinct to retch. Then, seeing a merc, he lifted his rifle and pulled the trigger. Bullets tore holes through the neck and face as the mercenary staggered back and forth, then fell against a wagon with the pulpy head hanging by a shred of flesh.  \n\nAs he searched the shadows for other mercs, Mahan suddenly heard the crunch of stone behind him. He whirled to fire— \n\nA second too late.  \n\nSeveral rounds pounded into his Kevlar vest like a jackhammer, sending him stumbling backward into the black soup of death. A moment later the surviving mercs loomed over the mouth of the well as a thick black fog coiled around them like a snake.  \n\nTaking a deep breath, Mahan closed his eyes and waited for a death that never came. Instead of a report ripping though the darkness like a clap of thunder, he heard a scream followed by a cry and then shrieks of agony. When he opened his eyes, the mercs were gone as though they had been erased by the fog.   \n\nMahan struggled through the putrid blood and fluids to climb up and out of the well. As he pulled himself over the gore-covered mouth he noticed the world had been plunged into an abyss of fog. Before he could make any sense of what was happening, something snatched his ankle—hard—and tried to pull him back down.  \n\nDesperately, Mahan gripped the edge of the well and held on tightly. He looked to his feet where he saw multiple hands yanking and clutching at his legs. He held on for dear life but his hands slipped in the blood and gore and soon gave way.  With a terrible cry, he fell back into the gore as boney hands clawed at his legs, his arms, his throat, his beard, his nose, his turban and pulled him deeper and deeper into the darkness.  \n\nNeedless of pain burst inside his head as he drowned in thick, fermenting blood. He knew with a strange resignation that he was dying, or that he was already dead, and that he would never know his niece or what had become of her. After his wife and parents had died in a plane crash and his brother had disappeared, she was the only one left. She was his only family, and he swore he would always take care of her. \n\nBut then life happened, and in the end, he had only taken care of himself. He had lived a lonely, selfish life counter to his upbringing and his beliefs. He was a walking contradiction who had somehow convinced himself that he was cursed, that everyone he had ever loved died or disappeared, and that he was doing his niece a favor by staying out of her life. He had somehow convinced himself that he was keeping his bad luck away from her while he amassed a fortune that he would one day leave her.   \n\nBut Mahan knew it was all a lie. He didn’t know the first thing about nurturing and raising a human being. Raising his brother’s daughter terrified him and that’s why he had clung to any reason he could to abandon her. All he knew was killing and destroying in the name of governments and corporations. And as the darkness swallowed him whole, Mahan realized in horror that killing and destroying was all he would ever know.   \n\nMahan had failed his ancestors. He had failed his family. He had failed his brother and his niece. He would never know her hopes, her dreams, her likes, or dislikes… He would know nothing except the inky blackness that swept over his eyes and the unnamable terrors that awaited him in the great unknown.  \n\n \n\nMAHAN OPENED HIS EYES WITH A START. He was still in the well, submerged in the putrid, death stew, staring up at thick black fog drifting over him as he heard a whirring sound—the sound of a motor accelerating and decelerating somewhere in the distance. He took a moment to gather his senses. He didn’t remember much. He remembered being shot, stumbling back and falling into the well. Everything after that moment felt like a nightmare that had been inspired by one of his father’s stories—the one where unarmed, peaceful protestors were shot dead and stuffed into a well and left to rot in the blistering Punjab heat.  \n\nWith a painful groan, Mahan reached out with trembling hands to a jutting rock and, with difficulty, pulled himself free from the gore. Rock by rock, he climbed his way up the festering throat of the well and finally pulled himself over the mouth and into the thick black fog.  \n\nA cry sounded over the incessant whir of the machine and Mahan quickly realized he wasn’t in Kenya anymore. He stood and took in his surroundings. There were strange structures like factories submerged in the fog. Scattered around the structures were piles of clothes and bodies set ablaze. Above in the pale red sky crows circled and cawed adding to the oppressive cacophony.  \n\n“Help… please…” \n\nMahan heard a woman crying for help coming from a bank of fog. Snapping out of his daze, he extended his hands and waved a tunnel through the fog, searching for the source of the sound.   \n\n“Help… someone… please… ”  \n\nThe disembodied voice reached him again, and she somehow seemed close and far at the same time. He froze to listen carefully, but all he could hear was the incessant whirring of the motor accelerating and decelerating.  \n\n“Help…” \n\nThere it was again. He moved left, then right, and finally he reached a woman in pilot fatigues stuck in a trap of twisted barbed wire. Without a word, he pulled the metal thorns out of her legs as she winced and squirmed in pain with every movement. “I don’t know what happened or how I ended up here…” Her voice trailed away, and she seemed bewildered.  \n\n“What’s the last thing you remember?” Mahan asked as he struggled with the barbed wire.  \n\nThe pilot stumbled back and answered with intermittent groans as she nursed her wounds. “I was on patrol… soaring through clear blue skies… when this black cloud suddenly appeared… and then the plane began to shake and break apart and… I don’t know… I was here…” \n\nA sudden click and they both turned wide-eyed to face the barrel of a rifle. Behind the rifle a man in black fatigues appraised them. “Who the fuck are you two?” \n\nMahan raised a hand. “Wait! Careful… we’re not a threat. We’re just as confused as you.”  \n\n“Who are you and what are you doing in Texas? Are you CIA? Is this some kind of a test?” \n\nMahan gritted his teeth. “This ain’t a test. And I’m pretty sure this ain’t Texas.” \n\n“Who are you?!”  \n\nThe agent shoved his rifle in Mahan’s face. But before Mahan could answer a Japanese woman in a black and red kimono emerged from the fog, unsheathing a katana with a high-pitched ring. She yelled at them in Japanese, and Mahan extended a calming hand to her.  “Please… put the sword down…” He then turned to the agent. “Please… put the gun down… let’s figure this out. “ \n\n“Who are you!” the agent yelled, pushing the muzzle in Mahan’s face. “I won’t ask again!” \n\n“I can tell you who I am, but that’s not the question, is it?” \n\n“Yeah! What’s the question, then?” \n\n“Where?” Mahan said flatly, motioning to the destroyed factories, the craters and the smoldering piles of trash and bodies. “I should think the question is: Where? Where are we?” \n\nAnother voice came from behind. “He’s right, you know. “ \n\nMahan turned to watch a man with a police jacket emerge from the fog. “We’re still trying to figure that one out… but right now we should all be asking: How?” \n\n“How?” Mahan repeated.  \n\n“Yes,” the detective said. “How much time do we have before The Horror finds—” \n\nBefore he could finish his sentence, a shriek followed by and high-pitched whine startled them. A moment later a mass of melded humanity and machine came at them.   \n\nMahan could make out several heads all shrieking battle cries in different languages attached to a patchwork of charred scraps from missiles, tanks, fighter jets, and nuclear submarines all bearing flags and strange logos of brands from different periods he vaguely remembered. He stared at this monstrous chimera in shock and wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at.  \n\nThe Horror, he called it. Looks more like the embodiment of war—sponsored war.   \n\nMahan swallowed a thickness growing in his throat as The Horror rushed the stunned agent and tore his head off, swallowing the terrified face and dripping neck like a ripe cherry. Then its ghastly mouth opened wide and a stream of fire torched the jerking, headless corpse as it collapsed into a heap of industrial garbage.  \n\nNot waiting to be next, the samurai lunged at the monstrosity and, with incredible speed and precision, cut it to pieces. Then all of them watched in disbelief as the pieces of flesh and metal slowly disintegrated into the living fog.  \n\nThe detective sighed. “It will be back,” he said, appraising the samurai. “18th or 19th Century. Red Crown Clan. You’re not the first. We could definitely use your skills here.” \n\nThe samurai sheathed her katana and grasped at the fog as though trying to capture pieces of it to study—as though she recognized it.   \n\nMahan approached the detective. “Where exactly is here?”  \n\nBut the detective didn’t answer. He merely turned his back on them and walked away, saying, “Follow me… if you want to escape.” \n\nMahan took in a deep breath and gathered his senses. Then he took to his heels and followed the detective into the unknown with the samurai and the fighter pilot in tow.  \n\n \n\nMAHAN FOLLOWED THE DETECTIVE through a labyrinth of bombed-out factories and mountains of garbage set ablaze. At the center of this industrial hell was a giant machine with hooks and cameras and television screens of every possible brand and size broadcasting moments of Mahan’s life as though his brain was a Wi-Fi signal that could stream his memories—his darkest memories. And not just his memories, but the memories of the samurai, the pilot, and the detective. It was as though they had been selected by some unnamable and incompressible intelligence for mere entertainment.   \n\nThe detective stopped when he reached what seemed to be a submarine hatch surrounded by a pile of smoldering trash and mangled, charred bodies.  \n\n“Get in!” he yelled, opening the hatch. “I'll explain what I know when we’re safe.” \n\n“Where does it lead?” Mahan asked.  \n\n“Away from here,” the detective said. “And that’s all you should care about right now. We don’t have time for explanations. But when we’re safe, Ben will answer all your questions as best he can. Right now, you need to—” \n\nA clanking noise suddenly interrupted him. \n\n“Go, go, go!” The detective yelled as The Horror came at them from the shadows. Instantly, he pulled out his flashlight, distracting The Horror as Mahan and the others escaped down the hatch.

","Text":"The sound of a bottle clanging against the ground greeted Haddie as she entered the half-burned building that had gone up in flames nearly a week ago. Thick, smoky air stung her nose as she stepped over shards of glass and heaps of charred wood. Bright city lights spilled through the shattered windows and crumbling walls. Carefully, Haddie picked her way across the floor toward the elevator, where she found the door leading to the stairs. A sign on the door warned her that the entire structure would be demolished in the morning. \n\nThere’s still time, she thought, as she ascended the narrow stairs. I’ve got a few hours to convince Max that he’s not crazy, that he’s not losing his grip on reality and that something is happening to our world. Something only a few of us can see and feel.  \n\nHaddie reached the last door at the top of the stairs and pushed her way onto the roof. There she spotted a man sitting on the ledge with thick, tangled hair and a weathered army jacket, drinking himself to oblivion as he stared out at the bright lights of the city.  \n\nShe approached him slowly, and he didn’t react or even turn to regard her when she sat down beside him. She merely sat in silence, listening to the police sirens wail in the distance over the horns and the muffled music coming from the clubs and bars below. At last, she said, “I thought I’d find you here.”  \n\nMax took a few swallows of rum. “I don’t know you.”  \n\n“But I know you, Maxwell.” \n\n“I don’t care where you’re from. I don’t want to talk.” \n\n“Yes, I can see that. You want to drink.” \n\n“Perceptive,” he said sarcastically, then extended the bottle toward her. “You’re welcome to join.” \n\n“No, thank you, Mr. Holt.” \n\n“How do you know my name?” \n\n“I know much more about you, Max.” \n\n“You CIA? FBI?” \n\n“If I were, you’d already be dead,” Haddie said. “You were an Olympic Biathlon athlete. You were a soldier. Iraq. Syria. Afghanistan. You left the military after an incident and after that you kind of pulled yourself off the grid.”  \n\n“You know how to use a search engine. You get a gold medal. Now leave me alone to my quiet time.” Max raised the bottle and took another swig.  \n\nHaddie narrowed her eyes and looked to the shadows on the roof beyond him. She couldn’t see anything but she could hear disembodied voices talking to him. She shut them out, then leaned closer to him. “I know you see and hear things others can’t. I know they follow you. I know you want them to stop. And I didn’t get all that from a search engine.”  \n\nMax lowered the bottle from his lips and fixed his gaze on a couple arguing on the sidewalk below. “You don’t know what I hear… what I see…” \n\n“Things from another place. Another world. Another realm.” \n\nMax swallowed a growing lump in his throat.  \n\nHaddie paused, then continued: \n\n“Something otherworldly attacked your unit and you survived because of your abilities and now… no one believes a word of it. You were ridiculed, discharged and silenced with an endless supply of opioids to fog your memory and neutralize your questions.” \n\nHaddie stopped as his eyes filled with tears.  \n\n“You’re not crazy, Max. You saw what you saw, and no drug or drink in the world will relieve the guilt or stop the nightmares. And that’s why you’re here, isn’t it… Waiting for morning to make it all stop.” \n\nMax cleared his throat. “What do you want?” \n\n“Your skills and abilities on my team.” \n\n“And what team is that?” \n\n“The one that is trying to stop the end of the world.” \n\nMax laughed uproariously, then stopped at once. “You’re serious?” \n\nHaddie grabbed the bottle out of his hands, took a swig, handed it back to him and nodded gravely.  \n\nMax shook his head. “What do you know about what happened to my unit?”   \n\n“Not much,” Haddie admitted. “What I do know is there are some very powerful people who have the answers or think they have the answers you’re looking for. What I do know is that since I was a teen I’ve been caught in the crossfire between two warring groups that need people like us to access this other realm and bring things back. I’ve been running from them for the last forty years, and I have helped others like us from suffering an unknown fate at their cruel hands.” \n\nMax’s face hardened. “They laughed at me. They said something in me snapped and that I had imagined the fog and the creatures that came out of it.” \n\nHaddie shook her head. “You didn’t imagine anything. I lost my brother in the same way.” \n\nThey exchanged a look.  \n\n“He’s not dead… I can still hear him… I do… but I can’t see him…” \n\n“Where is he?” \n\nHaddied shrugged. “I don’t know. All I know is we’re not the only ones who lost friends and loved ones to this phenomenon. And if we work together we might one day see them again.”  \n\nMax laughed and pulled on his bottle. “So you’re recruiting me? Is that what you’re doing? Recruiting me in some kind of paranormal army.” He laughed, again in disbelief.   \n\nHaddie watched him laugh. “I’m giving you what you need.” \n\n“And what is that?” \n\n“A second chance,” Haddie answered flatly. “Purpose. Meaning. A chance to save others from being murdered or used by the same assholes who are coming for you right now as we speak.” \n\nMax laughed. “What are you talking about? Who’s coming for me?” \n\n“I have a list—” \n\nHaddie broke off abruptly. She pulled out a gun from her jacket and shot two dim figures in the head as they emerged from the exit door. She then jerked to her feet and hurried to the bodies, searching their jackets for IDs without any success. “They’ll be more,” she said, looking up at Max as he stepped beside her with wide, confused eyes. “You’re at the top of their list and that’s why I’m here.”  \n\n“What list? What are you talking about?” \n\n“Follow me,” Haddie said. “And I’ll explain everything.”  \n\nMax nodded, dropped his bottle with a loud clang, and followed Haddie down the stairs, through the charred building, and out into the ally where a cab was waiting for them.  \n\n \n\nMAX HOLT STOOD IN THE BASEMENT of the Park & Sherwood bookstore examining a wall of pictures, notes and numbers covered by a web of red string highlighting connections. He narrowed his gaze on hundreds if not thousands of missing people from all over the world. Tacked between the pictures and notes were transcripts of horror stories from various podcasts decoded into numbers and coordinates. He then glanced around the room and noticed artifacts and artwork from ancient civilizations he did not recognize from any history book he had ever read, and he had read many. He turned back to the wall and noticed for the first time a picture of his unit in Afghanistan among countless other units that were missing in action. His face grew stern, his eyes narrowed, and he turned to Haddie and asked, “Is this the list?” \n\nHaddie stepped beside him. “This is the list of those we failed.” Her eyes fixed on a picture of her brother at a World War Two zeppelin crash site in the French Alps where they had recovered several “Wunder Weapons” that a secret unit of German soldiers was transporting for the Thule Society. It was the last time she had seen him before he had disappeared. “The list is of those that are being targeted by some very powerful and disturbed elites. They will either be killed in ritual sacrifice, or they will be used as tools to search areas that overlap with another dimension.” \n\n“I don’t understand.” \n\n“I know it’s a lot to take in. But these groups… they communicate through random podcasts and deliver encoded messages in stories and media. And we do our best to decode them.” \n\nMax scoffed. “Is this some kind of joke? Codes in stories… That’s your list?” \n\nHaddie shook her head. “This is real. There are people who are in serious danger, and you can help them. You left the government because they laughed and ridiculed you. That won’t happen with us. We know what you saw is real.”  \n\nMax approached the picture of his unit.  \n\n“I’ve got names and places and endless funds at my disposal,” she said. “We’re twelve to midnight, and only a few of us know it, and I need you on our team, not theirs.” \n\n“Minutes?”  \n\n“Seconds. Twelve seconds.” \n\n“These groups,” Max queried. “Are they that powerful?” \n\n“You have no idea.” \n\nMax extended his hand, touching the picture of his unit. He then followed a red string to a passage culled from a horror story. From the passage, he followed yet another string to a series of numbers—the time, day and place the creatures in the fog attacked them.  \n\nHaddie stepped away and soon returned with a folder, pulling out a picture of an abandoned cemetery in Chile along with a picture of a man. She handed the pictures to Max, and he stared at them for a long, thoughtful moment before nodding that he would join her team.  "},{"Title":"Chamber of Blood.

The Redcrane. Veil of Blood. 1. ","Text":"Several paths lead to the harbor where peasants and merchants had witnessed the strange arrival of a foreign ship. They discussed the ship and the arrival in the surrounding villages with mingled anger, fear and curiosity. Most believed the foreigners were here to disseminate contraband and rob their beloved land of precious artifacts. Many believed a band of thieves was selling these precious goods to these foreigners in exchange for their weapons. Some even claimed that they had seen these thieves on the gangway, loading stolen artifacts and relics from fallen lords and noble families onto their ship.   \n\nSaku Nakano stood in the moonlight, considering her options. There was the long and safe route along the dirt road, and there were shorter routes through the dark and deadly woods where many unlucky villagers had been killed by creatures—it was said—not of this world.  \n\nSaku knew of these cursed places all too well. She had lost her entire clan to these mist-enshrouded areas over the years and now she roamed the country—the last of The Red Crown Clan—seeking out the great corruption that was upon her people, finishing what her clan had started centuries ago.  \n\nThe enemies to her clan, The Black Serpent Society, served a nine-headed serpent made of black mist. They believed the black serpent would grant them powers and boons beyond human comprehension in this world and the next in exchange for unquestioning devotion. They were convinced that the black-mist serpent was a demon that slithered through these wooded cursed areas creating doorways into what they called The Belly of the Serpent, or just, The Belly.  \n\nSaku turned toward the dark woods, and sensing raw evil in her midst, she prepared to enter, thinking about the hushed conversations she had overheard in the nearby markets. She remembered the merchant hacking and gutting fish as he talked to a woman who was going through a bag of oysters she had just gathered in the sea. She remembered them talking about how they had seen bandits with pistols and gunpowder and other strange weapons.  \n\nI remember them mentioning the foreigners, she thought. They said they were Dutchmen. They were on the wharf speaking fluent Japanese with unknown merchants in plain kimonos with the exception of a strange serpent crest. They described the crest as a nine-headed serpent twisted in a circular knot as it chased its nine tails. They described only a few sailors and how most of the crew had perished of an unnamed disease during the voyage across the ocean. \n\nA sudden laugh interrupted her thoughts.  \n\n“Where is your husband? “  \n\nA man in a plain brown kimono looked her up and down in the pearly light of the moon as he approached her.  \n\nSaku met his gaze but did not react or respond. \n\nThe man placed his hand lightly on the hilt of his sword as he continued to appraise her. She was tall and lean with strong, sinuous arms and piercing dark eyes. She had long, black oiled hair gathered in a perfect queue, doubled over and tied neatly with a red and white sash. She wore thong sandals and a simple black kimono. A vibrant red sash around her waist held two scabbard swords. One sword was short and straight, the other was long and curved at the tip. \n\n“Where are your papers?”  \n\nThe man edged closer to her with dim recognition in his eyes. He had heard rumors of an Onna-Musha in a black and red kimono roaming the land, destroying the wicked while protecting those who could not protect themselves. Or did she roam the land seeking justice for her butchered clan? Or was she a bandit leader who raided and pillaged villages?  \n\nThe man couldn’t quite remember what he had heard, and he had forgotten the name people had given her. It was related to her clan and its origin. That much he knew, but not much more. It would have helped if he had paid closer attention when his wife had been discussing her many adventures with her sisters. \n\nBut he had ignored most of the stories as exaggerated gossip and legends not unlike that other samurai that everyone called a demon. There was no such thing as a demon samurai and there was certainly no such thing as a woman samurai that could perform all the feats the stories claimed she had performed.  \n\nSaku breathed deeply and placed her hand near the hilt of her long sword.  \n\n“Do you not see I am addressing you! Where are your papers! Answer me wo—” \n\nWith impossible speed, Saku whirled her sword in a gleaming silver arc and the man’s torso toppled off his hips and a fountain of warm crimson fed the ground. The twisted mouth twitched as it sputtered bile and blood and tried to make out the words, “Redcrane.”  \n\nHe had remembered— \n\nA moment too late.  \n\nReturning her sword to its scabbard, Saku sighed and said an inward prayer for the brute.  Then she stepped over his jerking torso and entered The Belly of the Serpent.  \n\n \n\nWITH CAREFUL, SILENT STEPS, Saku pushed smoothly through The Belly, paying close attention to the lurking black mist slithering through gnarled trees that seemed to shift and waver with her every step, as though to intimidate her.  \n\nDon’t make a sound, she thought, stepping down a slope through noiseless shadows toward the sound of waves crashing against rocks. She was close to the wharf. She could smell the seaweed, fish and salt in the air.  \n\nThere was also something else.   \n\nA strange heaviness in the atmosphere.   \n\nStaring up through the shaking canopy, she saw thick clouds marching across the sky. She sensed the floor moving, and looked down to see her legs completely submerged in the creeping mist. A moment later a branch cracked not ten paces away, and she knew she wasn’t alone anymore.  \n\nSaku neither ran nor hid. She froze, closed her eyes, listening carefully for threats approaching through the black mist that heaved and moved as though it were alive.  \n\nSaku knew she was somehow—as difficult as it was to explain—in two worlds at once. And she knew there were demons and monsters in the other world that hunted within these overlapping areas.   \n\nSaku didn’t know much about this other world. What she knew she had learned from her mother and father. The Black Serpent Society—they had once explained—believed the black-mist serpent was a living deity that consumed people, towns, civilizations and worlds.  \n\nThe Black Serpent Society believed that within The Belly there was lost knowledge and power from all these consumed worlds that could help them usher in a golden age of peace, prosperity and abundance. Their dedication, their devotion, their ritualistic killings were, in the end, for the betterment of humanity.  \n\nThe Red Crown Clan, however, believed the promise of a golden age was nothing more than a cosmic ruse—a shiny gold lure to snag minnows, fish and whales in the abyss.    \n\nWith a deep breath, Saku sensed the threats were gone. She opened her eyes and continued through wavering light and shadow as the wind began to pick-up and the mist grew thicker.  But then she stopped suddenly when she heard a familiar roar.  \n\nA thunderous roar that seem to shake the world.  \n\nThis time she didn’t close her eyes.  \n\nShe didn’t run.  \n\nThis time she silently lowered herself by a tree as she heard the pounding footfalls of a giant samurai in shiny green and gold armor approaching. She heard him smashing bushes and trees with his kanabo as he searched for her in the shadows. She knew without seeing him that she was being hunted by the samurai that had been corrupted and turned into a demon by the Black Mist Serpent.  \n\nHer sister had told her many tales about this samurai. How he had once been a man of honor and conviction. How he had hunted and executed corrupt merchants and false samurai. How peasants and villagers began calling him a demon because of his savage methods. And how he had ultimately been turned into the very thing he hated most, the very thing the stories depicted him as— \n\nThe Oni Samurai.  \n\nThe very same Oni her sister savagely battled long ago when they had been caught in the mist. She had escaped, her sister hadn’t and now all she wanted to do was take down this demon and make him tell her where she was.  \n\nBut Saku knew better than to lose herself in the past. She pushed the memory of her sister out of her thoughts and instantly found her focus. She looked through a gap in the trees toward the wharf, where she saw orange specs of light against the wall of darkness that was the sea. She could make it. She could outrun him to a place where he could not follow.   \n\nLooking over her shoulder, Saku saw the giant samurai only ten paces away. He was decked in shiny gold and green armor, and carried around his back a massive leather bag dripping, thick blood at the bottom. A few heads jutted out of the bag and clouds of buzzing flies surrounded him.   \n\nThe Oni searched the trees and bramble and was now only seven paces away. Unexpectedly, something jerked away from a bush and he launched at the creature and smashed it with his kanabo, losing his bag in the attack. The bag fell and dozens of heads rolled toward her.  \n\nOne head stopped at her feet and stared at her with wide open eyes.  \n\nSaku gasped as she suddenly realized she was staring at her own face. She fixed her gaze at the other heads in the mist and thought that they all seemed to resemble her, as though this demon samurai had already decapitated her countless times before.  \n\nNone of it made sense. \n\nImpossible, she thought. It cannot be. And yet… it is… Have I fallen to the demon before? Are there others like me in the demon world that made him? But look… a scar!  \n\nSaku observed the head at her feet and noticed a long scar on the side of her face. She instinctively felt her own cheek where the scar should have been. It was proof that this was someone else, though she could not deny the resemblance was uncanny.  \n\nSaku swatted flies and reached for the head to get a closer look, but then she suddenly froze when she heard a terrifying roar not five paces behind her. In one fluid motion she dove into a thicket as the kanabo missed its mark. Without a moment to spare, she scrambled to her feet and turned just in time to see a gore-covered kanabo with the crushed head of a rabbit coming down on her with devastating speed.  \n\nQuickly, she sidestepped and withdrew her sword. An instant later she slashed off the demon’s arm with a roar of her own. But knowing the arm would grow back in the mist, she turned and charged away, desperately running for the beach. She had downed the demon before, but somehow it always managed to rise unscathed to continue the hunt.  \n\nThere was no defeating the demon.  \n\nThere was only one option: escape.  \n\nAs she rushed through the woods, she turned back to see the demon chasing after her. She pushed herself to run faster and faster, and just as the demon lunged at her again, she dove out of the mist through a break in the trees to a place he could not follow.  \n\nThe demon samurai stopped suddenly and watched her closely.  \n\nSaku clambered to her feet, brushing off sand, seaweed and salt. She turned to face the edge of the woods where she saw red glowing eyes fade into the night. Then she heard the crunch of rocks behind her followed by a clicking sound. She turned slowly to face the barrel of a musket pistol glinting in the moonlight. "},{"Title":"Chamber of Blood. The Redcrane. Veil of Blood. 2. ","Text":"SAKU LOOKED BEYOND THE PISTOL to a man in a dark kimono and short black hair. He inched closer to her with a smile, but she did not move nor give him the satisfaction of flinching. She met his gaze and edged back slightly. Then she stared off in the distance where she could see shadows moving about a cluster of abandoned homes near the wharf. The small village had been abandoned, no doubt, due to its proximity to the woods and the creatures that lurked within the mist.    \n\nThe man cleared his throat and placed the barrel inches from her face.  \n\nSaku stared into his eyes without fear or concern. She looked down at his sandals and back to his eyes. “Move!” he ordered, his ignorant smile widening. “I know who—” \n\nA sudden flash of moonlight and his head toppled off his shoulders before he could finish his sentence.  \n\nSaku watched the headless body spray warm blood into the cool night as it jerked left and right and finally collapsed into a mound of shells and seaweed, startling a nervous crab that instantly scuttled away into the gloom of night.  \n\nSaku gripped her sword and patiently picked her way through the jagged rock formations to reach the small village where Black Serpent brutes guarded the area against anyone who might try to interfere with their dark rituals and secret trade negotiations.  \n\nShe moved silently through the shadows, following the edge of a home. She froze when she heard footsteps approaching. She slowly placed her back against the wall and waited. She peeked around the corner and saw two thugs telling stories about the demon samurai.   \n\nShe crouched slightly, then, like a mighty tigress, she leaped into the air and thrust her sword through the two heads. They jerked violently then collapsed when she pulled her sword from their skulls.  \n\nShe took a moment to survey the area, then made her way noiselessly to the wharf where three thugs laughed and made jokes about the strange red alcohol the foreigners had shared with them.   \n\nShe held her sword firm, and she started toward them, practically gliding with quick, smooth steps. Just as one brute turned to meet her focused gaze she lunged with blinding speed and— \n\nThree headless bodies suddenly staggered stupidly in the dark and collapsed into each other with arterial blood spraying darkness against the bright light of the moon.  \n\nWiping warm blood off her face, she climbed a series of crates, moved past a clump of fishing nets, and crouched by the gangplank. She listened carefully for movement and heard steps just above in the ship.  \n\nWhen the footsteps receded to silence, she moved stealthily up the gangplank and halted, scanning the ship, spotting one thug sitting crossed-legged on a crate. Beside him were several other crates bearing the VOC logo and name of the Dutch East India Company.   \n\nCarefully, Saku embarked on the ship and moved toward the brute. But just as she prepared to pounce, she heard a click, followed by a high-pitched wheeling sound. It took her less than a moment to understand she had been lured into a trap—less than a moment too late.  \n\nBefore Saku had time to react, she felt the heaviness of a net collapse over her as dozens of thugs surrounded her with dirty looks and curses. She then watched the sitting thug, the leader of the group, turn to face her.  \n\nThe leader smiled, stood briskly, and laughed. “We thought you might show up?” he said as he approached her. He made a quick wave with his hand, and the thugs instantly trained musket pistols on her. “You’ve been quite busy interfering with our good work.”  \n\nShe didn’t respond, but she pushed and pulled against the net to gauge its strength. She glared at him as she realized this was no chance ambush. The Black Serpent Society had been tracking her and had somehow managed to trap her. The leader shook his head at her.  \n\n“Your clan is destroyed. Your weapon is irrelevant and outdated. You’re outnumbered and trapped and still you think you can do the impossible.” \n\nThis will be difficult, she thought. But not impossible. I’ve been in worse situations and survived.     \n\nSaku inched closer to the leader as he smiled at her. She believed his reluctance to shoot her was evidence that they wanted her alive for one of their rituals.  \n\nThe leader motioned to all the thugs and laughed, again.  \n\nSaku gritted her teeth and studied the thugs as they slowly closed in on her from every direction. She looked into the leader’s thieving dark eyes and saw all the lies and treachery of the Black Serpent Society. Then, looking beyond his eyes, she visualized herself triumphing against her enemy, leaping from thug to thug, cutting them down with her sword like weeds.  \n\nSuddenly, the leader barked orders, snapping her back to reality. The thugs inched closer to her with hideous smiles and wide, nervous eyes.  \n\n“Surrender willingly,” the leader said flatly. “And we will reunite you with your clan—as misguided as they may have been.”  \n\nSaku understood his meaning.  \n\nHe believed their rituals would open a doorway into the nameless realm where they were supposedly trapped and cursed to live out an endless cycle of life and death for reasons beyond comprehension.   \n\nSaku didn’t know what to believe. What she did know was that she wouldn’t allow these thugs the satisfaction of serving her on a sacrificial platter to the darkness they served and she had promised to destroy. She had made an oath long ago as a member of the Red Crown Clan to cleanse the world of the reeking corruption that was the Black Serpent Society, and she planned to honor that oath.  \n\nWith the strength and power of her ancestors coursing through her veins, Saku instantly rushed forward, her hand thrusting through the net. Powerful fingers grabbed the leader by the scruff of his kimono and pulled him in. Then, using him as a human shield, she whirled as pistols fired and balls ripped through his belly, chest and skull.    \n\nThrough the rising smoke from the pistols, Saku could see the thugs trying to reload. Without a moment to lose, she tossed her busted and shredded shield to the ground, and, with difficulty, she sliced through the net with her sword. A moment later, she was a hurricane of death and destruction, leaping from thug to thug as her hissing blade painted the deck red.  \n\nThe thugs didn’t know what to do. They were too stunned to react. It was like fighting a ghost, a monstrous shadow, a formless mist with swords for claws. Their futile attempts to parry her attacks with pistols met empty air as limbs fell and heads rolled.  \n\nIt was a horrible nightmare, as if by some strange, ironic twist of fate the Redcrane actually drew her power from the black mist serpent so that she was somehow a servant of the very darkness she had sworn to eliminate.   \n\nWhen the last thug fell with a gasp, Saku found herself surrounded by blood and carnage. She took in the stench of gunpowder as her gaze slowly lowered to a thug groveling like a maggot. She had sliced his legs at the knees and he was crawling away with nervous elbows that slipped with every move in the growing pool of blood.  \n\nWiping the gore off her face and kimono, she blocked his path and crouched to face him. The thug looked up at her with widening eyes. A bleat of terror rose from his throat that rose to a shrill pitch as she raised her sword and ended his service to the Black Serpent Society.   \n\nSaku rose slowly, and searching the ship, spotted a cluster of oil lamps glowing and flickering atop a crate. With focused determination, she picked her way through the bodies and kicked the crate, sending the oil lamps scattering to the wooden deck below.  \n\nThe lamps spat liquid fire and set the deck and lifeboat ablaze. Then, walking away from the burning ship, Saku considered everything she had just experienced.  \n\nTrapped. How did they know she was coming for them? How could she have taken the bait? How had she been lured so easily?  \n\nEnough. Warriors do not waste time with what ifs and what they should have or could have done. What matters now is the present and taking the next right step.  \n\nWhere to now? \n\nShe couldn’t think straight.  \n\nDespite all her training, a flame of anger burst in Saku for her careless mistake. Yet, she repressed her frustration and knew there was no use for it. Anger would only cloud her judgment and waste her time. She needed to keep her composure because—  \n\nHer friends and family could not have perished in vain. Because she was the last of her clan. Because the Black Serpent Society had to be stopped. Because she the hope of all those who believed she would end the darkness that was upon their land. Because she was— \n\nThe Redcrane.

Dejavuism.","Text":"It was a book club, and they were arguing over the latest Edwin Cain novel along with the interview the author had given where he discussed a concept he had called Dejavuism. He put forward the theory that our brains are biological, quantum computers with vast networking abilities beyond our current understanding of physics. Cain believed that our quantum brains could connect to other beings with similar frequencies within the multiverse as though they were inter-dimensional cellphones. The club members, who discussed these theories and how they sometimes felt their inner voice was another version of themselves advising them from another time or place, began telling stories about instincts, gut feelings, and deja-vu experiences that felt all too real. There was one skeptic who scoffed at the idea of the multiverse. He thought the idea was ridiculous comic book nonsense, and he laughed at the very notion that our brains were interconnected, multidimensional computers that received or projected ideas from the ether.  \n\nOne woman exclaimed:  \n\n“It could be true. Such a theory would help us understand why ideas seem to come to us as a group, or why so many similar ideas seem to bubble up all over the world at pretty much the same time. Who’s to say we aren’t all tapping into the same stream of ideas.” \n\nThe skeptic answered: \n\n“It’s just coincidence. That’s all it is when a bunch of people from different places come up with similar ideas. And coincidence has nothing to do with the multiverse or other versions of ourselves in the universe.” \n\nAnother man shook his head and said: \n\n“I don’t really agree. There’s shit out there we just don’t understand, and I recently read the idea for Wi-Fi and cellphones came from a bunch of scientists trying to understand a gland in our brain. A gland that’s bioluminescent and seems to be searching for signals. Granted this could be online misinformation, but what is true, and what many cultures believe is that our artists can tap into things not of this world. What I found interesting was how Cain said these visions that artists receive are only accessible to those who experience trauma when they’re young, those who have been bullied, abused, exiled… those who have learned to shut out their reality for self-protection in order to fully experience other realities.” \n\nA woman added:  \n\n“The door to the physical world closes, the door to another world opens.” \n\nThe skeptic laughed and was just about to speak when another woman, an aspiring storyteller, interrupted him and said: \n\n“I get visions and dreams about the same place all the time. One of my recurring dreams is of Romulus and how he is taken up by a massive black storm cloud and brought to this dark realm where he’s chased by a hideous creature… a monster that could not possibly exist. What’s strange is he’s not alone. He’s not the only being hunted. He’s with a biker and two other Scottish men who at first I thought were sailors, but then I had this other dream that showed me that they were, in fact, lighthouse keepers. I did some research and I could swear by the pictures that the biker I was seeing was Yui Kimura, the one who disappeared a few years ago.” \n\nThe skeptic laughed and said: \n\n“So what your saying is the Emperor of Rome wasn’t assassinated by his generals but is somehow stuck in some kind of demented world with Yuri Kimura and two lighthouse keepers. This, you somehow believe, is real. Romulus and Yui are running from a monster as we sip coffee and tea in our cozy chairs and talk books and authors. This is what you’re putting forward as something possible? Something reasonable for all of us to believe?” \n\nA woman said: \n\n“It sounds a bit out there. But maybe there are things in the cosmos that are beyond reason or science.” \n\nAnother woman beamed at the aspiring storyteller and said: \n\n“Real or not, you should write a story for your blog or even for your next performance. I think it would be a lot of fun, even if it does require a little suspension of disbelief.” \n\nThe aspiring storyteller smiled and answered: \n\n“Actually, I have a draft I’ve been working on, which I wanted to share with the group before I posted it. I’m still not sure if it’s a story I can perform because it’s a bit complicated and messy, but maybe you can help me find ways to energize and simplify it.” \n\nEveryone nodded enthusiastically, except for the skeptic who rolled his eyes.  \n\nThe storyteller pulled out a coffee stained notebook and opened it to a story that she still hadn’t titled. She took a deep, calming breath and began: \n\n“This story doesn’t have a title but I’m thinking of calling it The Tragedy of Cliff and Alex, who were real people and who disappeared before most of us were born. Now, I’m not one to believe in conspiracy theories or urban legends but their story, which I acquired through extensive interviews and research opened my mind to the possibility that there is more to our lives than that which can be seen or proven.” \n\nThe skeptic quipped: \n\n“Well, that’s convenient, isn’t it?” \n\nThe storyteller ignored his comment and continued:  \n\n“Love, for example, exists and ceases to exist just as soon as we indulge in proofs and evidence. As soon as there is doubt… as soon as there is a need for proof… love is dead. And yet, we know love is a real. And we know—don’t we—that love is quite unreasonable. It’s powerful. It’s maddening. And we hate that we can’t define it. Love exists, and it doesn’t need to be proven in any way, shape or form for it to be real—” the storyteller made an exaggerated gesture to grab something in the empty air—”And yet, just as soon as you try to grasp it—it tatters at the touch. \n\n“Cliff Barra always loved horror movies. He started making scary movies when his father bought him his first Super 8 camera. And so it comes to no surprise that he grew up to be a famous director who translated his favorite gothic novels and horror stories to the silver screen. It’s also no surprise that when he met Alex Damaro, an equally famous art director known for his brilliant and visionary production sets and costume designs, that they were instantly smitten with one another. Together, it`s safe to say, they produced some of the scariest and most iconic films to date. But all this changed when Alex suddenly disappeared while on set in a rolling cloud of black fog the crew insisted they had not designed.  \n\n“From that point on, the movies stopped. A great heaviness came over Cliff as he found himself confronted by the horror that he would never see Alex again. He turned his back on his friends, his career, his life, and he became possessed by an obsession to find out what had happened to Alex. Investigations into this strange fog led him to a group of people searching for missing loved ones. With this group he learned about the existence of secret cults and societies that understood the black fog and the strange realm from which it came. He dug deeper and deeper, discovering his old movie set wasn’t haunted as everyone said it was… but was… a kind of doorway to another realm. So he returned to the haunted movie set where Alex disappeared and waited… and waited… He waited for days until finally he heard Alex’s laughter, and with the laughter came the fog. And the fog rolled in and carried him away.  \n\n“And so, Cliff ended up in another world that defied his wildest nightmares. He followed Alex’s voice through a darkness that had never known the light of day. At last, he came upon a forest of wooden stakes bearing skewered heads. He picked his way through the stakes, inspecting each head. The scene reminded him of one of the first films he had made as a teenager. He soon came to one head that resembled an old producer friend of his. Suddenly, the eyes sprang open, and Cliff started. At once, all the heads came alive, taunting and ridiculing him like he had been ridiculed as a child for his passions and hobbies.  \n\n\"But Cliff stayed the course despite the insults and the taunts that he would never see Alex again. One head of the thousands shouted louder than the rest. The head screamed that Alex was being corrupted and that he should turn back before it was too late. Realizing this severed head knew more than the rest, Cliff kicked the stake and caught the head as it toppled off. The head protested and yelled that it had once been a king and it didn’t want to be in the hands of a commoner. And Cliff promised the king he would release him after—and only after—he helped him find Alex.  \n\n“Long story short, the head lead Cliff to the edge of a massive gate that surrounded a town that resembled every production set Alex had ever designed for Cliff. Before he could take in the area, he suddenly heard Alex screaming in the distance. The king warned Cliff not to interfere with the process and explained that Alex was being twisted and tortured into a brutal, murdering monster for reasons they would never understand.   \n\n“But Cliff couldn’t bear to hear Alex suffer. Every agonizing scream was a dagger in his heart. And so, dropping the head, he climbed over the gate and, unperturbed by the formless creatures moving in the fog, he followed the cries to the top of a castle he recognized from his Frankenstein film. Cliff charged up the winding stairs to the roof, where he found Alex agonizing on a metal table as bolts of lightning struck him every few moments from a thick, black storm cloud. All around him in glass prisons filled with formaldehyde were all the monsters Alex had ever designed since he was a child. Cliff couldn’t believe what he wasn’t seeing. It was as if this living nightmare were all a projection of their combined memories.  \n\n“Cliff didn’t even try to understand what was happening or what he was experiencing. Without hesitation, he rushed up to Alex not knowing what to do. In the shadows he spotted an ax on the cobblestone floor and instantly grabbed it. Then, despite the deadly lightning, he pushed through the sizzling and sparking pain to smash the chains that bound Alex to the table. Alex opened his half-conscious eyes with difficulty. He barely recognized Cliff. Alex squinted with charred eyelids and managed to murmur words that made Cliff smile. Then Cliff hefted Alex over his shoulders and charged down the stairs and out into the thickening fog where frantic, formless creatures did all they could to prevent them from escaping.  \n\n“Cliff kicked, punched and charged through the fog, smashing through creatures, crows, and claws—everything and anything the world set against him. He remembered the king telling him something about a hatch—the hatch would somehow lead to freedom. Desperately, Cliff searched the ground as he heard a roar followed by a clap of thunder. Pounding steps chased him through the darkness. He didn’t even bother to look back. He rushed forward until he saw it! The glint of metal by a crumbling Gargoyle statue from one of his movies. He ran to the hatch, opened it, and lowered Alex to safety. Then, just as he was about to descend, something sharp like talons clutched his ankles and pulled him screaming into the raging fog!  \n\n“I’d like to say that it all worked out in the end and that they lived happily ever after. But that’s not the truth of this story. The truth is Cliff took Alex’s place at the torturer’s table and was turned into a perfect champion of horror with little or no memory of who he was or how he ended up in this dark realm. And Alex… well… He ended up with a group of stranded souls who did whatever they could just to survive. But that’s another story for another time. Suffice to say that love torments all—bringing the best and worst out of us when we least expect it.”  \n\nThe storyteller finished and everyone was silent and inward, thinking about what they had sacrificed for love and what they would sacrifice for love. But not the skeptic. No, the skeptic was turning the story over and over in his head searching for issues. At last, he broke the silence, asking: \n\n“What happened to the head? The talking head? Cliff just drops the king’s head and then you never hear about it again. It kind of makes the story incomplete.” \n\nA woman blurted out: \n\n“Who cares about the damn head? It’s a love story!” \n\nThe skeptic added: \n\n“Also, I don’t think you can use 'tatters' as a verb.” \n\nThe storyteller smiled and politely said: \n\n“I’m still working the story, and the ideas are still coming to me in my dreams. I’ve been logging them in my notebooks and I’ll re-read the current version more critically to see if I need to do something else with the talking head.” \n\nAnother woman said: \n\n“All that horror, and for what? To end up twisted and tortured and turned into some abomination worse than anything he ever filmed. I feel so bad for him.” \n\nA man said: \n\n“I don’t. Not because I don’t like him as a character, but because that’s just the kinda things we do for love—the horrible and the beautiful, the bitter and the sweet, the euphoria and the madness—” he lost himself in a memory for a moment—”Love twists and torments. And I’m sure there’s nothing that dark world can do to anyone that would surpass the torment of not knowing what had happened to a loved one… or worse… the regret of knowing what had happened and not doing anything.” \n\nAnother man said: \n\n“Well, I do hope you publish this story on your blog. I found it heartbreaking and terrifying… and I guess I’m wondering if you really think this is what happened to the real Cliff and Alex.” \n\nThe storyteller shrugged and closed her notebook as she prepared to leave. She wasn’t sure what she believed anymore.  \n\nThe skeptic laughed and said: \n\n“I’ll tell you what I think. I think the real Cliff and Alex faked their disappearance to get out of the limelight, and they moved far, far away to some gorgeous, exotic island where they’re eating grapes, drinking margaritas, and living happily ever after.” \n\nThe man said: \n\n“Well, I do hope you’re right and the story is just a story.  But if you’re not… well… I hope Alex will one day be able to do for Cliff what Cliff did for him.” \n\nA woman said: \n\n“It kind of makes you wonder if the characters we read about in the books are actually real somewhere.” \n\nAnother woman said:  \n\n“A story in this world, reality in another.”   \n\nThe storyteller stood, smiled at all the book club members, and excused herself as she had an early shift at the café. Everyone said goodbye, watched her disappear out the door, and then returned to their discussion about Edwin Cain, Dejavuism, and the story they had just heard.

Fit in with her cousins. Fit in with her teammates on the soccer pitch. But fitting in isn't as simple as being like others. She's different and she knows it.<br><br>She feels slow. Unresponsive. Not quick enough to understand her teacher or keep up with her class.  The librarian calls her ‘addle minded.' When she talks, she stutters. Sometimes she loses her breath and has trouble recognizing when she's talking too loudly. But most of all her teacher embarrasses her. Says she's in the clouds. Always in the clouds.

Her mom doesn't want her to collect plants and bugs anymore. Her dad says that's the best part of her and he doesn't need a child who fits some bell-curve. More than this he defends her. He tells her mother that the greatest treasures gifted to the world were from those who didn't conform. Who weren't normal. Who didn't fit some outdated bell-curve. Tolstoy. Tesla. Einstein.

She's talking to her about her ‘issue' and how her ‘issue' is really a blessing in disguise if she can just learn how to succeed in a system that favors one type of ‘smart' at the expense of all the others.  A system that frowns on taking chances or making mistakes when making mistakes and taking chances is what is needed for learning. For true learning.

Things like ‘bell curves' and ‘ideal student' don't apply to her and that's okay. The ideal mold is a prison for those wired differently and her teacher has set her free.  Her grades are getting better and a test is coming. She writes, visualizes, and imagines everything she needs to remember and somehow this works. The right teacher at the right time can make all the difference.<br><br>Her parents are proud. Very proud. But still her mother wishes she had friends. Still her mother wishes she liked what other girls liked. Her parents argue in another room about what to get for her birthday. Her mother wants to buy a new doll.

Maybe this year she'll smile and pretend she didn't want a magnifying glass or a collection of stones or a set of books on botany. Maybe… to make things easier… she'll pretend.

Stabbed the bear endlessly. Killed the bear. Ripped open its stomach to retrieve his brother's head. Carried his brother's mutilated body ten miles to their family estate. This time it's ten miles.

Deep down he knows his father murdered his uncle. Tied him up. Left him for a bear. There was no knife. No fight. No honor. Just a terrible death for a disloyal worm.

And there, perhaps, lies the key to its destruction… if an Ancient can be destroyed at all.<br><br>End the trials. Destroy its ability to sap dark nectar from victims like a cruel parasite feeding from a flower. At least the Archives affords me a better understanding of the Entity… why it moves from universe to universe, picking victims off and devouring worlds as though at a cosmic buffet.

This is not by chance. It is, to my mind, self-preservation. Victims who know this truth and have honed their ability to manifest could be poisonous to The Entity.

She follows the source of the sound into the decimated forest where she sees a small canvas tent and Russian soldiers  guarding foreign prisoners. She watches them all evening. She watches horrified when they execute one of the horses for dinner. So much meat wasted due to sloppy butchery. After dinner the Russians grab one of their foreign prisoners and crush his head with a shovel to pass the time. They laugh and make jokes. She watches them in the shadows and laughs silently. Not with them. At them. A shovel is clunky. The blows are awkward. The death… messy.  These men are neither fish nor meat. Her mother taught her better."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2433","Text":"She was going to search for another pack of human animals but something catches her eye. Something that reminds her of her father. Something perfect for her little bushka. A gift. Anna hides in the shadows and fixes her gaze on the gift. The Russian soldier carves the gift as he guards and swears at foreign prisoners in the shredded canvas tent. They kill and torture each other because they cannot talk to one another. She remembers a book her mother once had. She pointed to the pictures and called them soldiers. They were the ones who butchered her father. Soldiers tear each other apart for reasons her mother could never explain. She watches them and doesn't understand.  She's not sure they do either. Maybe they like the hunt, the scent of fear, the bloodlust. She stares at the perfect gift and wants to give them a little war they'll never forget. But there are too many and her mother suddenly appears before her with a smile and tells her little Anna she will need to thin the ranks. I can do that. I will show you. I will show you, and I will show them… where crawfish sleep. "},{"Title":"MEMORY 2434","Text":"The Russian soldier does a peculiar thing to his prisoner. He ties him to a gnarled branch by his ankle and lights a fire a few inches under him. She scrunches her brow. Confused. You kill the game before you roast it. But these soldiers enjoy his agony. She recognizes the yelling and shrieking foreigner. Just a few moons ago he was torturing Russian prisoners in another tent. Just a few moons ago he was the tormentor. The Russian holds the perfect gift in his hands while the prisoner shrieks and squeals like a pig. She smirks. It's kind of a funny cry. It is. It's amusing. The Russians make jokes and imitate the squealing cry. She fights down explosive laughter. It's the most ridiculous sound she's ever heard. The sound of an approaching soldier suddenly startles her. She wheels to see a glittering bayonet rushing her. She evades and grabs the pathetic, scrawny man by the neck, curls her callused fingers around his bulging apple and yanks with devastating fury. With a choked gurgle he collapses and lies dead on the ground with his throat torn out. She returns her attention to the laughing Russians and the squealing human swine. She smiles. They'll all be making similar sounds when she's through with them."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2435","Text":"Four Russian soldiers lurk around the tent searching for their missing comrade. Anna stealthily tracks one soldier, inching closer and closer with every step. Poor pea-green mule.  He has no sense these will be his last few breaths. She watches him for a long moment then strategically steps on a twig. The crack makes him turn, but before he meets Anna's gaze, her axe splits his nose between the eyes, smashing his teeth and severing his tongue. She covers his bloody mouth with her hand as she rummages through his pockets for the perfect gift. Nothing. She raises her hand to let the choking, gurgling sounds lure the other three. Carefully they approach with bayonets raised and ready. She grinds her teeth in fury and bloodlust. She rolls their comrade's severed head in their midst. A moment of shock and it's all she needs as she leaps out and drops two soldiers with one lash of her axe. The other soldier rushes in with a scream and she meets him with a sweeping stroke that severs his head clean off the torso.  A geyser of blood erupts as his headless torso staggers stupidly back and forth as though searching for its lost head. The torso staggers forward then pitches backward and collapses. The sounds of another attack reach her before the blade. She lashes left and right and the body collapses in mangled pieces. The soldier stares at the pieces of his body around him in terror. She laughs and thinks about that story her mother used to tell her. Sorry yaytso. Can't be put together again."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2436","Text":"Anna finds these soldiers curious. Where once the Russians and foreigners were roasting each other alive… they are now… working together to survive her attacks. They are calling her a ghoul, a monster, of the forest, saying she is a bodark. Together the soldiers dig pits and sabotage their camp. Anna toys with them. She's outnumbered and she knows it. She weakens their senses by depriving them of sleep. Every night she approaches their camp. Sings a lullaby then howls like a bodark. The soldiers wake in a frenzy and scuttle in terror as she returns to her cabin to sleep with her little one. She rests for a few hours then returns to her little war to reignite a cycle of terror. One or two sleepless nights and they'll be ripping each other apart. It will be a matter of walking in and taking what belongs to her little bushka."}]},{"VignetteId":"Tome03_Dwight","Name":"A Story By Any Other Name","SubTitle":"Memories: Dwight Fairfield","Entries":[{"Title":"MEMORY 2112","Text":"Lazar approaches Dwight and slams his desk.

His hands fidget nervously. He swallows a growing lump in his throat. Lazar smashes his desk again. I need you to be bolder than him, Dwitch. I need you to get the buzz out there that we're the best company in the business. Did he just call me Dwitch? Dwitch? He just called me Dwitch. Dwight's still not sure what he's supposed to be doing at Peak 22. He's a Story-Hook Supervisor. He has no idea what that is.  Sounds convoluted and made up. Sounds like bullshit. He took the job because he needs the money and he can't dress up in costumes for birthday parties anymore. Kids can be so cruel. He's supposed to create fake profiles and write positive reviews about Lazar and his company. Lazar gives his desk another thump! Be a lion, Dwitch! Pounce on the internet! Pounce! Get the word out! Peak 22! We design Story-Hooks for ads that transcend humanity. Dwight has no idea what that means. Lazar leaves a test on his desk and walks away. Dwight stares at the test unsure.

Gotchya."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2113","Text":"Our thing is Story-Hook advertising. Dwight cringes every time he hears Story-Hook. Lazar's trying to be different just to be different. Most advertisements use stories to wrap a message in emotion. Just because you call it a Story-Hook doesn't mean it's new. Doesn't mean it's different. Story-Hook is a term used by high-school English teachers. Rose laughs. Yes, but Lazar's an idiot and he wants to feel like he created his own theory for his upcoming book. Dwight's eyes go wide. Book? What book? Rose laughs absurdly and explains. An autobiographic book. A guaranteed bestseller highlighting Lazar's new theory on creativity. But Lazar hasn't done anything yet. It's all smoke and mirrors. Rose laughs and corrects him. He's done one thing really well… He's burned through millions. Rose changes the subject and tells Dwight he needs to meet Lazar's ghostwriter for an interview. Make sure to shower praises about our naked emperor for his autobiography."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2114","Text":"Dwight approaches Rose. She isn't her usually jolly self. Dry tears line her cheek and her eyes are swollen. She tells him Lazar embarrassed her at a meeting when she refused to go along with his jokes at the expense of the sound designer's speech impediment. He humiliated her for not going along with his stuttering impression. Rose sighs and advises Dwight to record all meetings with the Naked Emperor. Not just for legal reasons but for the yearly roast. Dwight raises his eyebrows curiously. Yearly roast? What yearly roast? She tells him about a yearly gathering of ex-employees who get together to laugh at Lazar's stupidities. Dwight tilts his head. He's really confused. In his mind Peak 22 just opened its doors. How long has Peak 22 existed? Rose calculates on her hands. Five years. Dwight can't believe his ears. Five years and Peak 22 has nothing. Rose smirks. Correction. Five years and we almost have Lazar's biography and his theory on creativity."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2115","Text":"Dwight showers Lazar with online praise using fake profiles. It's the coziest job he's ever had. As he prepares to create another false profile he suddenly hears shouts coming from Lazar's office. He freezes as Lazar verbally assaults the Peak 22 lawyer. The lawyer is telling him Story-Hook can't be registered. It's a concept in many high school textbooks. Lazar fires the lawyer on the spot. The lawyer promises he'll sue. Lazar doesn't care. He'll settle. He always settles. It isn't his money, and Dwight's heard he's got his benefactors eating out of the palm of his hands. He's already settled dozens of wrongful dismissals. Rose attempts to calm Lazar down, but he screams at her to mind her business.  Dwight wants to help her… but… he's… never made so much money doing so little before. He likes making money doing nothing. But… his hands are fidgeting and his palms are getting damp and clammy. Hearing Lazar verbally abuse Rose is difficult to bear. He imagines all kinds of scenarios where he leaps from his desk to help her. Nervousness fills his bladder, and he leaps from his chair and rushes to the bathroom."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2116","Text":"The Brilliant Mind Inc. Lazar announces the title of his autobiography to the entire office. It feels like a joke, a bad joke, but it's not and the studio is trying not to laugh at their Naked Emperor. Lazar hasn't done anything in the five years since he convinced a bunch of millionaires in his Story-Hook revolution. He doesn't even have one successful advertising campaign. They had a few clients in the beginning, but Lazar wanted to write and direct the commercials himself and made a mess of everything. Dwight suppresses a laugh. Rose claps when Lazar concludes his presentation.  Amazing! Paradigm-changing! How gracious of you to share the secrets of your success with the world. Everyone gets her sarcasm except Lazar. That's the thing about narcissists. They believe their own press release.  Lazar turns his attention to Dwight. Dwitch…  What do you think? Dwight suddenly feels the blood drain from his face.

Peak 22 has done nothing and creating campaigns with a Story-Hook isn't really paradigm-changing. The publishers think he's an idiot. What is he saying Story-Hook when he means Story? Ads with a story. A story with a Story-Hook. Rose calms Lazar down. She suggests that they should self-publish. The idea silences Lazar. You're right! You're absolutely right! The publishing world isn't ready for my visionary ideas. Dwight sighs and finds it harder and harder to listen to his bullshit. Peak 22 is going nowhere fast. The company is having a hard time finding clients and recruiting with all the rumors of abuse. Lazar announces he has a solution for recruitment. He'll write a Story-Hook recruitment campaign to attract the best employees.  Hundreds will apply. Thousands.  Dwight doesn't understand. For what? Dwight still isn't sure if Peak 22 does anything other than enable a narcissist to do whatever he wants to whomever he wants."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2118","Text":"Lazar is spreading rumors about Rose. Dwight consoles her but she's inconsolable. She says it's a pattern. His pattern. He discredits, destroys, and demolishes an employee before he fires them. He spreads the rumor he later uses to fire the person. Dwight says she's exaggerating. Rose shakes her head. Lazar's in trouble. He just spent more money on a one-minute ad campaign for Peak 22 than a Hollywood blockbuster and his investors want answers. He needs a fall girl. Someone to blame for the mismanagement of company funds. Dwight doesn't understand. She explains that Lazar's already left a trail of blood in his wake. The last three women in her position were all promoted and fired for Lazar's excesses and stupidities. Lazar has an upcoming meeting with his investors. She will be this year's patsy. Dwight gives her a skeptical look. She shakes her head. You'll see. He spends the money. A woman takes the fall. That's Lazar's idea of equal opportunity.

He interrupts her on every slide in front of everyone then cancels the meeting. He acts as though it's the first time he's seen Rose's deck. He announces Rose has no idea what a Story-Hook is. Everyone leaves the cafeteria feeling bad for her, grumbling that no one knows what he means by Story-Hook or how stupid he is for using a contrived term that just means story. Dwight doesn't understand because she validated every slide in her deck with Lazar. He heard them agree. Before Dwight can talk to her she is fired and escorted out of Peak 22. Dwight watches his friend, a single mother, walk out. This year's patsy for Lazar's excesses. He siphons the investment money and his friend gets the boot. The whole meeting was a set-up to discredit her in front of everyone. Lazar approaches Dwight. Sorry, Dwitch, I know Rose was your manager but I had to let her go. She wasn't aligned with our company values. Dwight stares at Lazar in mingled shock and horror. What values? He wants to scream at Lazar. He wants to grab his ears and rip them out of his narcissistic head. Instead he nods and silently prays there is justice in the world."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2120","Text":"Dwight listens in disbelief to stories of Lazar. Real life horror stories. Stories that defy reason for this day and age. It's a yearly ritual for those who have had the misfortune to work with Lazar. They've all gathered to watch the leaked Peak 22 recruitment video. Dozens of people, each wearing a white Peak 22 t-shirt with a ridiculous Lazar quote they scribbled on with marker. One of them worked with Lazar at a production company where he tried to produce a terrible web series he wrote. It's about an alien computer that takes over the world and controls its inhabitants with a matrix that simulates reality.  No one told him he just pitched the premise of a major blockbuster film. She imitates Lazar selling his web series. It's different. It's unique. It's not horror, it's not sci-fi… it's terror… sheer terror… it's… it's a new genre… it's Simulated Terror. Lazar believed he had created the next big genre like cosmic horror. The writer shows a book written by Lazar. Simulated Terror. Guidelines for writers in his new genre. They all burst out laughing. Dwight laughs so hard it hurts. Who says Story-Hook when they mean story? Or Simulated Terror when they mean sci-fi? The stories of the Naked Emperor continue throughout the night and Dwight is convinced there is no justice. Peak 22's ex-Story-Hook supervisor talks about how Lazar called him a ‘weak male' for not wanting to ‘cyber bully' a blogger for using the term ‘Story-Hook.' He tells them about a harmless drug that makes people laugh absurdly at every little sound. He says if he was still working at Peak 22 he'd give Lazar a little taste of his own medicine. Others agree. That would be hilarious. Dwight likes the idea. Likes it a lot.  It might be that justice works in mysterious ways. He approaches Max. Tell me more about this harmless drug."},{"Title":"MEMORY 2121","Text":"Max hands Dwight a mix of his laughing drug. It will make him giggle and laugh so much he'll piss his pants. Pour it in his coffee right before his meeting and you'll have a ‘Story-Hook' unlike any other for next year's roast. Dwight smiles. He feels his heart pounding his chest. Rose will have justice. Everyone will. Dwight will teach this abuser that sometimes the little guy bites back. Inspired, he asks one of his colleagues to distract Lazar while he spikes his coffee. Another colleague listens to the plan and shakes her head skeptically. She isn't sure. She doesn't like this prank and cautions Dwight to think things through. I've got two kids, she says, and the last thing I want is for the investors to close down shop because he hallucinates or hurts someone. Dwight laughs. Don't worry. The most that will happen is he'll act like a donkey. Dwight lifts his chin proudly and reassures her no one will get hurt.

Ormond was full of them. Ugly people. Entitled preps and politicians who would turn blue in the face if you challenged any of their beliefs. Julie hands Frank a ski mask. He gives her a curious look.

Granted, spiking a narcissist's drink and watching him unravel was worth the price of admission.  The many memories of survivors struggling with narcissists have led me to the conclusion that there are only three possibilities when relating to a narcissist. Enable them. Run away from them.

You were supposed to keep a look out? You were supposed to warn us. He takes the bell and cries out for his grandmother in a raspy whisper, but the whisper turns into an endless scream. He screams until he loses his voice, and all that answers back is the deafening silence of the cold, indifferent night. He falls to his knees, taps his bell with his finger, and wishes he could just disappear from this living nightmare."},{"Title":"MEMORY 660","Text":"Village to village it’s always the same scene. Death and destruction. Burnt cars, homes, and bodies. His people disappearing in a seemingly endless mixture of fog and smoke. He can’t move anymore. He doesn’t have the strength or will. The smoke stings his eyes. The stench makes him want to retch with every inhale.  But most of all he can’t take… the silence. The horrible silence. The oppressive, dreadful, indifferent silence. He stops and sits by a tree with a vulture hovering close to him, waiting for him to die. This one wants its meat fresh. Raw. Not burnt or doused in kerosene. He closes his eyes for a moment and drifts away, far away, but soon he hears a voice… a voice like his mother’s… he opens his eyes to see a woman and several muddied children staring at him. The mother extends an open hand. You must come with me. Philip doesn’t answer. He can’t answer. There’s no warmth or wetness in his mouth. His throat is like sand. His eyes are like tar. The woman hands him a flask, and he drinks as though he’s never had water before. She tells him her name is Funanya and that he should come with her. I don’t want to run anymore … I want to die… The mother keeps her hand extended. And that is why you must live… you must live to tell others what happened… to bear witness… Philip stares beyond the woman and fixes his gaze on one boy and two girls.

There’s blood splatter on the wall and a dark, familiar stench.  Philip doesn’t want to think about what happened to the owners. For a moment he sees his mother approaching him, but then she disappears to reveal Funanya. She approaches Philip with some salvaged school supplies. Sometimes drawing helps get you get your mind off things. Philip shakes his head. He doesn’t want to draw and he doesn’t want to do math. He doesn’t want to do anything but wake up from this terrible nightmare. He stares at the other boy… Emeka… as he draws a picture of his village. He has a dozen colors to choose from, but he only uses black. Funanya doesn’t understand why but none of the colors appeal to him… it’s as though he’s stopped seeing color. Philip stares at the picture of the colorless village and steps outside where Nikki and Chika keep watch. He shows them his father’s lucky bell, though he’s not sure it’s so lucky anymore. He hands it to Nikki, explains she should ring it if she sees anything."},{"Title":"MEMORY 662","Text":"I hate the smell of kerosene. Funanya nods and agrees with Philip. It’s not the kerosene but everything else attached to it. Nikki looks at Funanya and asks why the crews are burning everything. Funanya doesn’t answer and maybe she doesn’t know. Philip turns to her. They are burning evidence. Nikki and Chika look to Funanya, and she nods. Philip hears his grandmother’s voice. Death plus destruction equals good business for devils disguised as humans. Philp grinds his teeth and answers the disembodied voice. They should all be killed… those who pay for murder and those who profit from murder…Funanya stares at him. Philip… don’t say such things… they are trying to take our humanity from us and that is the one thing they cannot take unless we give it to them.  \n\nPhilip feels his face harden. I don’t want a sermon. I want my family back. I want them to pay for what they did.  Funanya puts a hand on his shoulder. Pray to the angel of mercy that we survive so that we may bear witness. Philip stares past her at the growing night. I’d rather pray to the angel of death and watch them suffer. Forgive, and be forgiven. I can’t! I hate them! How can they take money to do such things? There will be justice, Philip. They will not get away with their crimes. Philip doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t say anything because like his father he believes that those with money, those who can afford killing crews and the quantities of kerosene required to burn humans by the thousands, can get away with any crime they choose to commit--even mass murder. She can pray for mercy all she likes. He’d rather pray for vengeance."},{"Title":"MEMORY 663","Text":"Those who profit from murder are worse than animals. He can’t get the idea out of his head that people would do such dreadful things for money. If he survives this… if he escapes this scorching hell… he’ll have his revenge. He can’t help but share his dark thoughts with Funanya who says that an eye for an eye is not the way. That an eye for an eye would make the whole world go blind and plunge us all into infinite night. The world go blind? The world is already blind to what is happening to him and his people. To hell with the world. The world doesn’t care. All this unrest and destruction was meant to happen. It was a mathematical formula to divide and conquer and rob his country of its beloved resources. He heard the elders say this a hundred times. Funanya gives him more wise words from dead leaders and he stops talking about revenge. For a moment he thinks that maybe she’s right. Maybe revenge is not the solution. Maybe the world will one day wake up from its slumbering indifference and help his people."},{"Title":"MEMORY 664","Text":"Nikki hands Philip back his bell in the dark night. It’s his turn to watch for killing crews, but he hasn’t slept in days and his eyelids are stones. He holds his bell close to his heart and for a moment just a moment he closes his eyes. Just for one minute. He awakens in the heat of morning with a start and a terrible feeling. He vaults to his feet and searches for his new friends. He finds one… pieces of one… of another… he’s not sure. He hears someone moaning. He searches and finds… Funanya… not dead but dying… sliced at every tendon… writhing in agony… covered in something golden… honey… they poured honey over her… and a million tiny black things swim, drown, and gorge on the gold and crimson streams dripping from her open wounds.  \n\nThe ants are crawling under her skin and eating her alive. He kneels beside her and tries to swap them away but it’s no use. They’re everywhere. Funanya whimpers and sputters blood as she tries to speak. But her tongue is missing and all that issues is a terrible, rattling noise. Philip kneels before her. He doesn’t know what to say or do. I fell asleep… I’m sorry… so sorry… but sorry doesn’t put her back together again. Sorry doesn’t get rid of the ants or bring back the children she was protecting. She barely scratches something with her finger in the dirt. I forgive.  \n\nPhilip stares at the words for a long moment. Silent tears fall as he raises his hand in front her face. She closes her eyes and waits for her suffering to end. He doesn’t want to do it, but he has to. He knows he has to.

No one takes pride or ridicules the animals they slaughter. He’s never seen anything like it. Dogs without humanity, that’s what they are, dogs, rabid dogs, nothing less, nothing more. Something ancient tugs at him. He feels darkness like a tendril from another world take hold of his young, innocent heart. Not young or innocent, anymore. He hears Funanya’s voice. Forgive, and be forgiven.  \n\nBut he doesn’t want to forgive and he doesn’t want to be forgiven. He wants them to suffer like they made his people suffer. He wants them to suffer for taking everything from him. He hears his grandmother’s voice trying to distract him from his dark thoughts of revenge with infinite math problems. But over her voice is the raging, maddening heartbeat of his hate. Her voice screams out equations and challenges. But he glares at the men. He feels kerosene coursing through his veins and he’s ready to explode. An eye for an eye and the whole world plunges into infinite night. Good.   \n\nPhilip notices the guns by the jeep. He could grab one and shoot them all. But he’s never used a gun and they’d probably run away. He could find a knife or machete… but these dogs would overpower him… Just walk away, Philip.

The window eventually closed, and I spent the entire evening imagining how such a thing could be possible or if it was merely an illusion. The same night another surge of energy permitted me to open a doorway into a realm I didn’t much recognize or dare explore. I stared at the scintillating doorway until it faded out of existence.

Later I used the Auris to manifest The Storyteller to read his stories like he had done for his weekly podcast. He was composed of ever-moving, black fog, and I suspect that one day I’ll actually be able to recreate a more realistic person to listen to or perhaps even engage with in something that resembles a conversation.  Listening to The Storyteller and hearing familiar expressions I am wondering: how do I keep myself out of my own creations? The memories I attempt to record as fast as I experience them prove one thing to me. They show me objectivity is impossible, or elusive at best, and I’m never quite sure if my logs are a true and accurate depiction of the subject’s memory or a whiskey laden interpretation of a nightmare. To add to my frustrations, I have recently noticed other voices have made their way into my notes. Other interpretations.

I approached and stared into the remnants of a war-torn, abandoned city with the eerie cry of a baby echoing in the distance.

Staring out into the endless abyss of black fog I thought that this prison could very well be another form of trial disguised and designed to feast on all the psychic energies derived from alienation, boredom and all those bouts of unremembered insanity.

How stupid is the city and that bastard of a mayor to allow such a thing. She searches for the perfect spot, the perfect surface to tag. She sees a spot high up in the open. That should annoy them. She sneaks to the front door, sees a camera, spray paints the lens of camera, begins to tag the wall. They poison water to provide bottles for good water. Absurd. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. Nea finishes her good work with time and paint to spare. She searches the premises and finds a large white garage door. Smiles. Perfect. She'll tag her name nice and big for everyone to see. That oughta piss off a tyrant as Casey says. The cause is actually getting to Nea and she wishes her art would piss the factory and the city enough for them to clean up the river. Wishful thinking. They came. They profited. They left… left an entire community poisoned. Gotta be laws against that and maybe even a death sentence for those who knowingly poison children."},{"Title":"MEMORY 689","Text":"So you tagged their building. Big deal. Means nothing. You got your name out there… that's what you did… but what does that name stand for? Nea doesn't know how to respond to Casey. She's never really attached a message to her street name like others. It's just not something she thought she'd ever do. It's not about a message. It's about art. Casey says art is the message. Art is rebellion. Some call it preaching. Who said that?  Who made that up? The corporations… Nea… of course they did. Get artists scared of using their art, of saying anything against their abuse and they win. Centuries ago artists protested tyrant kings and those tyrants did all they could to own or stifle their art through fear of poverty or fear of death. Nea… kings still exist… they do… just in different ways.  Today the kings are CEOS and their kingdoms are corporations and some are good kings and others… not so good… and the not so good one have found other ways to keep artists in line. Scare them in school. Tell them not to make a statement. Tell them to stand for something. Appeal to all. Just entertain. Entertain and inspire but don't say something.  Don't be political. Nea… everything is political. Not say something is say something. Turning your back and ignoring corruption is a choice, a political choice of indifference. Nea sighs. She doesn't know. She's not sure. She's never really done it before like the others. It always kind of rubbed her the wrong way. Casey scoffs at her tag. Stand up for something or stand for nothing.  Your choice as an artist. Your political choice."},{"Title":"MEMORY 690","Text":"Come with me. Casey jumps on her board and leads Nea into The Narrows. She leads her to a home where a father helps his son eat food in his bed. He's only eleven. Never had a chance. The only mistake was trusting those who were supposed to protect him. He's dying. Mercury poisoning. Before people in The Narrows died of natural causes… now it's all mercury poisoning. Casey sighs and shakes her head. You sign your tag over the culprit's garage door and all you've done is advertise your street name. I heard your bullshit about not using your tag for a cause. What's the use of a tag then? What the use of a voice if you ain't gonna say anything? Ain't gonna stand up for something. Art is an act of defiance. Not an act of profit. Not an act of fame. Say something, Nea. Let the world know what's in your heart. Someone just might listen and do something. Lend your voice to the voiceless. Not rebel without a cause. Rebel with a cause."},{"Title":"MEMORY 691","Text":"Nea thinks about what Casey said as she lies in bed staring at a glass of water. Casey's right, and Nea remembers a time when she wanted to say so much as a street artist. Somehow that got stamped out of her. She tries to remember how it got stamped out of her. The only thing she can think about is… school. No messages. No politics. Nothing. Just inspire and entertain. Yet corporations have messages and politics. Politics of selling. She remembers being told not to use art for politics yet who does that benefit? Kings. Tyrant kings trying to own voices or stifle voices by creating an inner self-editor that begins in school. Keep politics out of it! Keep politics out of it? Everything is politics even the act of trying to stay out of politics. Politics… fuckin politics… fuckin corrupt mayor… Bastard didn't just switch good water for poison water… he sold the good water to a corporate king. Absurd. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. She never heard of such a thing. No one should own the rights to water. No one. Water belongs to everyone. To all living things. Nea stares at a spray paint can on her dresser. She thinks of something to say. Something to make people stop and take notice. For the first time in a long time she doesn't care if it's a message or a political statement. Screw her high school art teacher who made her feel insecure about making statements with her creations. Water is health. Water is strength. Water is a human right… Water is a human right… a basic human right."},{"Title":"MEMORY 692","Text":"Nea is amazed at how many poor communities shower, bathe, cook and do their laundry in poison water because a few kings bought the rights to their good water. It's absurd. Ridiculous. Unbelievable.  She's never felt so involved in a cause before and she likes the feeling. Possibly her first cause since school tried to stifle her voice with fear of making mistakes… of saying something… of having a message… of going against the corporate dream. Not the American dream, the corporate dream. Nea surfs the net and reads about the kings and their scramble for fresh water all over the world. She's happy to read it's not going so well. In every country where these tyrant kings tried to own fresh water they were kicked out by the people. Yet these stories are difficult to find. Kings losing battles to peasants is rarely breaking news or news at all. Almost like the kings want to make sure no one gets inspired to fight against them as they desperately scramble to buy up all the water they didn't poison. They want it all. They want to sell it. And they don't want peasants getting in their way. Water is everything.. Owning water is like owning life. Owning water is deciding who lives or dies. And that's what the kings and the mayor did in Falls City. They condemned and poisoned an entire community and did nothing to help them. And did nothing…  Nea hopes in a higher justice, one that can't be owned or bribed, and she swears she'll turn the mayor's new luxury car into a work of rebellion. Can't change the world, but you can make it a little bit better. A little bit better… that's enough for her."}]},{"VignetteId":"Tome05_Hillbilly","Name":"A Man Named Boy","SubTitle":"Memories: Max Thompson Jr.","Entries":[{"Title":"MEMORY 3728","Text":"In the darkness of his cell he hears footsteps approaching. He hears laughter and gossip. His father with others. He's not sure who he's with. He puts his ear to the door and hears a laugh, a deep guttural laugh. He feels his skin crawl and his stomach twist in knots. It can only be Chief.  He hates Chief especially when he's with his Pa. They make him do all kinds of things for fun and laughs. His Pa brags about his killing tool as he often calls him. More laughter. Other voices. Chief brought some deputies to enjoy the show. He wants to smash them all to bits just to make them stop laughing. Everyone laughs at him. The whole world laughs at him. He grinds his teeth with frustration. They ain't supposed to laugh. They're supposed to protect him and he knows it. He's seen it on his TV, the only thing that calms him and keeps him company when he's done his work. TV is something special… the friend and parent he never had… But Chief… Chief ain't like those on TV.  \nHe's another kind of Chief of police.  The kind that works with Pa to clean money. He doesn't even know what that means but he overheard them by the pigpen talking about cleaning a whole load of money and sharing that load with a judge and other men of the law.  They clean money together. That's why Chief lets Pa and Ma do whatever they want to him. Chief is crooked his Pa always says. Crooked like his boy's face. The laughter grows louder. They approach his brick dungeon and he shivers at the thought of more slaughter. He's tired of killing to make a few deputies laugh. Real tired.  He feels his blood boiling, feels it rising through his neck, feels it pushing up his face like it wants to burst through his skull. A sudden high-pitching whistling noise fills his ears. He hits his head over and over again until the whining stops.  Silence returns, for a moment, just a moment, and then a chain rattles. Bolts snap loudly as he loses balance and falls back to his haunches. The door opens filling his brick cell with blinding sunlight. He covers his eyes with his arm. His Pa steps inside, grabs him, and yanks him to his feet. Come on, Boy! Let's show these deputies your worth!"},{"Title":"MEMORY 3729","Text":"In the sweltering barn he stares at the blood dripping from his hammer feeling as though he were in a dream. Strange. Weird. Unhinged.  No. Not a dream. More like… like he's living on a TV show… watching himself from a distance.  Slaughtered cows thick and wet all around him. Seven or eight of them writhing helplessly in warm, coagulating blood. Heads cracked open. Brain and gore spilling out. Flies buzzing around him, buzzing in his face, buzzing in his ears, telling him this slaughter is who he is. This senseless slaughter is his worth… his only worth. Kill. That's what they love to watch you do. Kill. Kill. Kill. The flies are laughing at him. Laughing with Chief and his deputies.   Telling him he's so useless he don't even have a name.  Boy! What kind of name is that! His Pa shoves him toward another cow. You ain't done yet!   \nBoy raises his hammer and shakes blood from his eyes. He feels strange. Weird. Unhinged. Fed up. He's had enough of this life. The cell. Shoveling manure. Slaughter. Endless slaughter. And taking care of those pigs. Those prized pigs—pigs given more love by his parents than he ever got. The flies circle his face and laugh at him. The high-pitch whining returns. The pigs got names and you didn't! Duke and Donny. He swats at the flies. Pa nudges him. Come on, Boy, show'em you can do more with that hammer! Boy… That's what Pa calls him.  Boy… That's what Ma calls him. They think he's too dumb to know he doesn't have a name. A real name. He knows.  All his life he knew. He knew and imagined himself as Max… Max Thomson. Imagined his Pa was so proud of him that he gave him his name. How he dreamed to have his father's name… how he dreamed… Pa shoves him. Come on! Show'em! Show'em now! Boy feels his face fill with blood. His veins swell with fury. His temples throb maddeningly. The next moments are a blur. Blood and screams everywhere! Not bovine… human… the whining begins again and he's confused, searching for his Pa but not finding him.  \nThe whining stops and everything is muffled. He turns to see Chief charging him. What have you done!? Boy doesn't really hear him. It's like when Ma held his head in a bucket of water to teach him not to call or cry for her when he was a child. Everything's muffled, distorted, surreal.  Chief tackles him and grabs the gory hammer out of his hand. You killed'em!  Your Pa! Jim! Don! Ray! My men! My fuckin men! Boy pushes Chief off and tumbles out of the barn, drenched in blood, heading toward the main house, screaming for his Ma in the growing dusk."},{"Title":"MEMORY 3730","Text":"Ma sobs on the ground with a mouth full of cracked teeth. Boy lifts her with one arm and a flood of inarticulate words rush out of his mouth. Words he only understands. Words the TV taught him. He wants to know his name, his real name, and she just stares at him, confused, lost, desperate. She gurgles blood and chips of tooth slip down the side of her face as she begs for her life. Even if she understood what he was saying she could tell him nothing. My name! My name! What's my name! Boy slams his Ma against the ground again and again. He lifts her over his head and hurtles her against the kitchen table. It breaks under her weight. Blood gushes from a wound in her leg. She loses consciousness. He feels bad and holds his limp body. Why? Why did you hate me? What did I do to make you both hate me so much? Her face is beautiful and hideous at the same time. Evil veiled by beauty. He hugs her, harder and harder, wishing everything would have been different, wishing he were one of those damn pigs. They spoiled them with love, affection and time—all that time they spent Duke and Donny while he groveled nameless and alone in a dungeon built just for him.  \nHe tries to lift her but slips in a pool of her blood. She struggles in his embrace. Every time he asks the question he squeezes her tighter and tighter. My name… What's my name? Her struggles cease and she jerks spasmodically. Tense arms and legs go limp. He releases her slowly. Her head thumps hard in a puddle of blood. She stares upward with blue vacant eyes. Beautiful blue vacant eyes. Eyes that only saw a monster, a thing, a beast of burden to work the farm.  Never a son. Never her son. He hates those eyes. Those…those… hateful eyes. He rips them out and squeezes. They pop like bovine eyes.  He smiles and doesn't really know why he's smiling. He wipes blood off his face and likes the mushy feeling in his hands. He hears a foot pound the floor behind him. Chief suddenly rushes into the kitchen.  I'm gonna smash your head with your own goddamn hammer! But as he lifts the hammer he slips in an inch of warm blood. Boy panics and rushes outside into the darkening woods with Chief screaming and cursing and bullets whipping by him."},{"Title":"MEMORY 3731","Text":"Boy doesn't know how long he's been running but he's tired. He hears Chief yelling and hollering after him in the distance. Says he regrets the day he told his parents to keep him as a farm-hand.

Let a pot of boiling water spill over you, and told us you were a clumsy child. They says you pulled the pot down from the stove, but I knew better. I seen right through'em. Too embarrassed of their deformed kid that they poured scalding water over him. Tried to kill you! Tried to make it look like an accident. Boy covers his ears. Flies buzz about, laughing. He doesn't want to hear this. A high pitch ringing echoes though his mind. Stop! Stop! Stop! But it won't stop. He knows he's the only one who can hear the whining and laughing flies. He knows he hears things. He knows his Pa hurt him. Hurt his head. Screamed too loud in his ear when he was a baby. Screamed mean things. Mean things like he wished Ma's belly-cord strangled him completely and not just halfway. He takes a moment to gather himself. He hears other voices. Chief called in more deputies. Doesn't matter. Let them all come. They all deserve to pay for doing nothing while his Ma and Pa made him suffer."},{"Title":"MEMORY 3732","Text":"Boy squeezes the neck so tight screams quickly fade into pathetic whimpers. Easier to kill a man than a cow. Only a man makes much more of a fuss. Boy stares in the deputy's panicking eyes and knows this one. Knows him well. This one laughed at him many times. Laughed at him when he should have helped him. Who's laughing now! Didn't you watch TV. The police are supposed to help, not hurt.  Laugh at me now! Boy lifts him off his feet and pounds the back of the head against a tree. Over and over again! Laugh now! Laugh! Laugh! The skull splits open like a melon and brain mass hangs from one side. Boy releases him and the dying deputy can barely keep his balance. He toddles left and right and stops in front of Boy. For a moment he stares at him as though seeing something more than a tool or a freak show. Something smarter than a mule. Smarter and deadlier. The deputy seems lost and confused… like a mindless zombie on TV. The trembling, confused deputy shuffles forward feeling his wet mushy head. Boy moves to the side to let him pass and stares at his good work. Stares at the gore dripping from his skull like putty. Watches him stagger left and right in the moonlight. If he were a cow, he'd end his suffering. But he's not a cow. He's something else. Something vile and corrupt. Boy watches him disappear in the shadows.  He stares at the darkness until he hears a thud. A strange feeling fills his heart and he… laughs. Feels good to fight back and show them his worth—his real worth."},{"Title":"MEMORY 3733","Text":"Boy hears Chief searching frantically for him. He sits still by a tree covered by bramble, squeezing a handful of deputy brain.  It's got the same texture as cow brain. He probably couldn't tell the difference if he had a lump in each hand. He squeezes and likes the feeling. It soothes him, calms him, relieves his anxiety. His thoughts wander to his favorite TV shows. Ma and Pa let him have a TV to shut him up.  They got tired of him smashing the wall and crying for them. Nothing worked. Not the gag or the rope that he always managed to get out of. Only the TV. TV was better than any constraint. It kept him sitting down, passive, complacent and quiet. Ma said it hypnotized him and that was a good thing.  \nThe TV showed Boy so many things. Showed him how different his life was from other children. Showed him what parents should have been like. He wishes his parents were more like Clark's parents. They made a hero out of their son just by being good to him and raising him right. They took good care of him and he wasn't even theirs. Or… the other parents… the parents of that other boy, Beaver. He had a good family. But he wasn't like them. He wasn't like Clark or Beaver. He came into the world hurt, deformed and weak like a runt. His Pa told him he had wanted to stuff him in a bag with rocks and throw him in the lake. Tough love. Tough life. Tough everything.  \nHe hears deputies shouting in the distance. Boy feels scared and does what he usually does in his brick cell. He closes his eyes and thinks of Clark and waits for the greatest of all heroes to save him. He never comes and it's not like TV. He's always there to save the day. He's always there to help those who need help. But TV ain't reality and he's alone. He's alone because he was born a crooked little beast. Boy opens his eyes and stares at the gory lump in his hand. Doesn't matter. Enough waiting. He's own kind of hero today."},{"Title":"MEMORY 3734","Text":"Chief screams his anger. Found bits and pieces of another deputy. Boy is picking them off like cattle in a barn yard. Chief swears to hell and beyond he'll make him pay. Make me pay? Me? You're the one who's gonna pay for letting me rot in that cell for all those years.  Chief calms down and calls someone. Tells them to bring the dogs. Bring them! Won't make a difference. No matter what he ain't ever going back to that cell or any other cell for that matter. He'll die a thousand deaths before they ever lock him up again. He wants to rush out of the darkness and grab him but something tells him that's exactly what Chief wants. He's trying to lure him with hurtful words. Boy sits in the shadows and stirs the dry leaves with one hand. He sees a deputy approaching with a flashlight. He grabs a thick branch and slowly rises and inches toward him. A hare springs in the air and bounds away. The deputy trains the flashlight on the rodent. He releases an anxious breath just as Boy swings the branch like Babe Ruth. Head and neck are smashed open and the dark contents splatter on the trees and ground. Yet the deputy doesn't fall. He stumbles here and there with his smashed head barely hanging by sinews of flesh, his hands desperately reaching out and feeling the cool, night air. Reminds Boy of a decapitated chicken fluttering about the yard searching for its head.  Boy smiles and feels liberated. He laughs to himself. Another deputy made clean. His Pa cleaned Chief's money now Boy cleans his deputies. Like father like son. He thinks of Chief and loses his smile.

Dogs that can track a cricket fart in pile of manure. Boy didn't even know crickets farted. He learned a lot of things on TV but never that. The thought of a cricket farting makes Boy smile. He likes smiling. He crawls closer to the police crew. Two new men on the hunt with Chief but he doesn't see any dogs. He figures he best take them down before the dogs arrive. He's seen police dogs on TV. They can sniff out anything. These deputies seem angrier than the last. He's not sure if it's because he felled their friends or if he ended their cleaning racket with his Pa. Maybe both. He just gets the sense if they catch him they'll make him suffer and squeal like a pig. Those pigs. Those damn pigs they loved so much. Why did they have to love them so much and him so little.

Reminds him of a scene in a cowboy movie. He approaches the other deputy. The deputy turns and grabs Boy. They roll over the crunching leaves and fallen branches exchanging blows. Boy manages to wrap his arm around his neck and squeezes. Legs thrash wildly here and there. Boy squeezes until they stop at once. He hears Chief calling back his deputies. He tells them to come back. Says the dogs have arrived. Boy retreats into the bramble and shadows. He closes his eyes imagines a different life for himself.  He's the Beaver boy, sitting at a table, eating a wholesome meal with his Pa and Ma and they're asking about his day. Then everything changes when he speaks. The sounds upset his Ma. She beats him across the head, holds him down and pours hot sauce down his throat and tells him to never speak again. His Pa grabs him and gives him a lashing with his belt. His eyes spring open. Everything could have been so different had he not been born a monster. Born a monster? Monsters aren't born. They're made. Made in a crucible of hate, cruelty and abuse. Hot sauce and belts!

Chief's voice grows louder. Your Pa gave you a name before he realized you were a crooked freak of fuckin nature! Your name shame him! That's why he hides you! You want to know your name, come out with your hands up and I'll tell you!  Before Boy realizes what's happening a dog rushes out of the darkness and attacks his arm with a vicious mouth of sharp teeth and dripping slobber. Boy wheels toward a vague, fast-moving shadow and grabs the wrist before the hammer crashes down on his head. He throws the dog against a tree. He's never felt such strength, such power, such resolve. I have a name! He shakes the wrist and the hammer falls with a thud in the gloom below.  \nBoy wrestles Chief to the ground. Chief pulls out a knife. Boy grabs Chief's wrist and forces him to plunge it into his own belly. See my worth now, Chief! See my worth!   Chief pulls the bloody knife out.

The dogs leap at Boy and rip him off Chief before he can do more damage. Boy smashes the dogs to the ground and searches for his hammer to finish his good work. Dogs slowly rouse and bark. He grabs a branch. Smashes them hard and charges away before they attack again. He runs for what feels like forever through the cold, dark woods and heads toward the farm… toward the house where he always should have lived. It's still not too late. There are secret rooms in the basement, rooms where his Pa hid his money and where his Pa and Ma could hurt him without anyone hearing his screams. He bets he could hide there a long time before anyone ever found him. He bets it would be real cozy especially with his TV. And he bets he'll find his name, his real name, in his Pa's stuff.
